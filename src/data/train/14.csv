84057,INSIDE,PlayStation4,8,"An excellent atmospheric, twisted, clever, affecting, piquant, surprising, vicious and fascinating game. As much fun in a group (passing the controller on when you die) as it is playing alone in the dark, it definitely needs to be played to the end.

95360,Monster Hunter: World,PlayStation4,2,"This game is the perfect example of why professional reviewers, in hock to big games publishers, and legions of franchise devotees often can't be trusted.

I like grind, I like difficulty and I like backtracking. I'm not in a rush to get trophies or finish a story. But I dislike seeing my character disappear inside dead monsters or plants, difficulty being increased not by challenging foes or scenarios but by a silly control layout, and mindless repetition and button-mashing.

119051,Horizon Zero Dawn,PlayStation4,9,"My opinion of Horizon Zero Dawn is that it’s the PS4’s benchmark game. I’m not sure it actually does much new but everything it does, it does to such a high standard that I’d be hard-pushed to name a game that betters it. My only reservation is that, even on its Ultra Hard setting, its a story-driven game that doesn’t offer much of a challenge, except for the insane Frozen Wilds trainingMy opinion of Horizon Zero Dawn is that it’s the PS4’s benchmark game. I’m not sure it actually does much new but everything it does, it does to such a high standard that I’d be hard-pushed to name a game that betters it. My only reservation is that, even on its Ultra Hard setting, its a story-driven game that doesn’t offer much of a challenge, except for the insane Frozen Wilds training ground. It makes up for this with such gratifying combat and stealth mechanics that I spent days ignoring quests and just hunting Stormbirds and Thunderjaws instead. It is one of the most enjoyable games to be simply playing.Horizon Zero Dawn's main story may echo familiar sci-fi setups but it twists and rejuvenates them in original and fascinating ways – when game publisher CEOs talk about transporting you to new worlds, they’re talking about games like Horizon Zero Dawn. The environments Aloy traverses are spectacularly designed and rendered and, again, echo places and include monuments we know but in enormously emphatic and poignant ways. The machines are exceptionally well-designed in relation to their roles in Project Zero Dawn and obviously take deliberate inspiration from our own world. In praising the work of Hannah Hoekstra and Ashly Burch in their excellent portrayal of Aloy, it’s easy to overlook the many other characters and performances that bring HZD’s world to life while the soundtrack leaves a lasting impression with Julie Elven’s haunting vocals soaring above it. The game’s side quests are compact stories in themselves, never repetitive or dull, and sit comfortably and meaningfully in the world. The game is a joy to play.Sumptuosity. 9/10.",Genjira

Playing as 2B, I found 9S's close attendance annoying and, at times, he interfered with gameplay (e.g. when trying to stand on top of a column). I felt the characters could have done with some transitional animation between walking and running but, since you spend most of your time dashing and sprinting, that's a fairly minor niggle. I also found the middle section a tad choresome sometimes, but it doesn't drag on and there's some great new gameplay involved. That's all I can think of to deny Nier: Automata 10/10. It's a truly great game: the story is magnificent, the combat is varied and tons of fun in and of itself, the visual presentation and soundtrack are equally beautiful, the upgrade paths are complex and satisfying... it all amounts to a deeply rich and rewarding experience and one I look forward to repeating on the Xbox, after the passage of time.Gorgeousness. 9/10.",Genjira

124778,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,Xbox360,9,"Interesting that everyone is so quick to bash the graphics and the linear design of this game when all shooters are like this.

I didn't see any drastic increase in graphics from World at War to Black Ops, but nobody seems to be hung up on that. Modern Warfare 3 is an excellent new edition of the Modern Warfare series with new environments and an interesting storyline, however predictable at times. I will admit that I was a little disappointed that there seems to be less sniper missions than ever before (those were always my favorite) but that aside, the game is awesome. Special Ops missions are really fun,  and survival mode is pretty cool too, though I haven't fully sampled all the different levels. In short, if you don't like this game, chances are you don't like shooters in general. There is nothing unlikeable about this game, and the complaint that there are no new mechanics to the game-play only attests to how polished the first Modern Warfare was when it came out. I'd like to point out that Black Ops actually took a lot of the same mechanics that Modern Warfare used, so it's not really fair to bash Modern Warfare 3 for using the same mechanics that it used in Modern Warfare seeing as how the mechanics were (and in my opinion, still are) so advanced when they were first introduced. I do wish they incorporated the running dive that Black Ops had though.",CaptainSalty
159451,Call of Duty: Black Ops,Xbox360,5,"Not the biggest fan of this game. I basically bought it for the Zombie mode in it, which is off the chain in my opinion.

I basically bought it for the Zombie mode in it, which is off the chain in my opinion. I enjoyed how the multiplayer was designed to encourage continued play and leveling up by having so many minor achievements that could earn you points as you played, but overall the multiplayer lobby system was such a failure that it is almost unplayable for me. Constantly getting kicked out of lobbies because the host could not be migrated is simply inexcusable. Same thing in the zombie mode multiplayer lobby, which is an even bigger problem, since sometimes you'll find the good fortune to find everyone else having a mic in your lobby, then you get kicked out and have to wade through all the other mic-less goofballs out there who seem to think that they can be Rambo and survive without communication with the rest of the group. Single Player campaign had a lot of ""explosive"" moments that fell short of any emotion or awe-inspiring feelings to me. I actually struggled to finish single player mode, and not because it was too difficult; it was too BORING!! I might be alone in this feeling, as most of my friends disagree with me on this, but there you have it. I recommend buying this game only if you are ready to shell out the extra 30+ dollars to download and play the zombie maps, which are very very fun to me, although I feel raped after looking back and seeing how much I payed for them all... Well, not really, but it's still a complete rip off, despite the fun that can be had from playing them. This game gets a 5 from me ONLY because of the zombie mode. Not worth the full retail price for the game; I wish I had waited until it cost less, about 30-40 dollars less to be more exact.",CaptainSalty

The graphics are good though like i said, a 7.5/10 for our time. The 6 vs 6 in the game is right on and makes the game enjoyable.  No one wants 30 bots running around on a map at a time, that wont be fun.  The campaign mode is fun, but note *it is a multi-player  6 vs 6*.. same thing as multi player but has dialog and a little story behind why you are fighting.  I'm just angered at at the content.... It's low.. and they want to sell a little bit more content later for $25 more...   If they add more FREE content the game will advance and be better in all.

I guess I was used to certain things that made the game a bit easier to play. The fact that there was a button to use the hopstep made things easier for me, as well as having the pick and roll in the playbook also made the game easier. They certainly made the AI (not Allen Iverson) a lot smarter, much better on the defensive end. The games biggest flaw is having players hit open shots 100% of the time. It doesn't make sense, if you watch NBA games, you clearly see that because the player is wide open, doesn't mean he is going to knock down the shot all the time. Another thing I didn't like was player tendencies. For example, Tyson Chandler doesn't take jump shots. He's a low post guy. Why is it that i've seen him take more jump shots than down low hooks and lay ups? On the positive side, My Player mode is tremendous, I love what they've done with it, as well as the Creating a Legend mode. Both of those modes alone will consume a lot of time and are extremely worth it.

However there are things in this game, that could have been much better. Underlaying RPG-world is one of those things: there is simply nothing fun about it, there is no ""magic"" in it, that we grew to love about say Forgotten Realms. Same can be said about story and quality of npc interactions, dialogues, the overall script. No better is the RPG-system used in TES, which offers bland items, overly problematic crafting options that are best ignored and cumbersome console-oriented interface, that quickly shift your gameplay into few-tricks pony whack-em-all because doing anything more complex is just impossible. Have to say however, that current system is still an improvement over Oblivion.",Tkwz

Because I've been told to go stealth road by the game itself, chosen that road and while it was playable for a while, I eventually got to first boss. I was thrown into a small area, wearing stun and tranq weapons, stealth and hacking augs and had to fight a terminator, with a leading cutscene so UTTERLY DUMB that I lack words to describe it (he - my lovely player avatar hero - waltzed in into a room and got ambushed!

Or maybe there was a way, but 2 hours was enough trying for me. I've uninstalled and I'll go back to it maybe in a year to fastforward it terminator way, the way I SHOULD have been playing apparently. The main reason I did that, was simply being told by game itself to go stealth, avoid combat and be a pacifist and then be literary SCREWED OVER, put into exact opposite without any out of jail card available. This is nothing like original deus ex, even tho that game sucked in so many ways, it did give me one redeeming quality - that I could just equip GEP gun and oneshot that annoying boss aug when he ran at me, with his goodies all turned off, trying to initialize dialogue. No, this game designs the gameplay, it tells me what is the right way, what is the wrong way, it sterilizes everything to narrow the possibilities to JUST THAT and it does this so badly as to ruin not only my fun, but literally the game I'm playing, forcing me to start over!!!

For instance:Settlement Creations- Feels like a rushed concept, it's unappealing, and pretty difficult to work with. It is, by no means, a requirement, but Bethesda sure talked it up a lot.Weapon Modding- Cool concept, but poorly executed. Having to hunt for scrap items with screws in the wasteland is just as annoying as it sounds, and the entire system pretty much boils down into being a chore.Dialogue- A partially interesting concept, and it is acted out rather well, but it deeply takes away from the RPG characterization. Not that this game is much of an RPG to begin with. The fact that there is only one voice selection per gender is seriously annoying as well.Despite this stuff, it does do a few good things. The gunplay is extensively improved, there are a lot of companions to choose from (But ""Leveling' them with weapons and armor is nearly inexistent, at least in my experience) and it still has an open world to explore. The game is fun more often than it is not, I'll give it that.I despise the leveling system. In a massive gutting of RPG elements, Bethesda decided to remove stats, and replace them solely with perks. It's a pretty annoying system- especially when it comes to crafting weapons and armor.Overall, the game isn't bad, but it certainly isn't the effigy of greatness we were promised, and is more than a bit disappointing.

""Meh"" is really the only word to describe the experience. At best, the campaign is serviceable.Competitive MP: What a **** I thought MW2 was bad. This... this is something terrible. There is no shortage of frustrating WTF moments when watching kill cams. Perks ruin any semblance of balance. Killstreak rewards leave out any hint of fair competition (juggernaut suit, seriously?). The MP feels like I'm playing tag at an elementary school. Every map is a circle that has a pathway cutting through the middle; it just has a different coat of paint. Speaking of paint, the color scheme in the MP is awful. Each map picks a color and focuses on it which leaves everything just sort of blending together incoherently at medium to long distances. I know that it doesn't seem worth griping about, but stare at the screen long enough and it gets annoying. If people wanted evidence of copying and pasting, look no further than the MP. The dialog and voices are taken straight out of MW2. The sound files are literally pulled out of MW2. The MP constantly rewards you with trinkets to make you feel like you're progressing. I don't like that so much. If I'm doing bad, let me know. Don't tell me I was the best at falling from high places and surviving or spending the most time aiming through my scope. Tell me what I did that caused my team to lose. Don't try and make me feel good about things that don't matter.Co-op MP: The new survival mode is fun enough, but it doesn't do anything better than other games that offer similar modes. I can see myself going back to that mode for some fun with a friend, but why is it limited to two players when every other game out there offers a minimum of four? The same with spec ops. The spec ops mode is the same as MW2. It's fun for one play through, but there really isn't much point after that in my opinion. And the two-player limit is disappointing. I was hoping for bigger ops with more players. But it didn't deliver in that regard.Overall: People say the game is solid. This is true. A shooter that runs at 60 FPS consistently is hard to come by on a console these days. But, I would happily take a hit in FPS for more visual spice--some aspects actually look graphically worse than its predecessor--and improved animations (which are awful, by the way). The game engine is showing its age. I have a 1996 Subaru with 200,000 miles on it. It works. It gets me where I'm going. I fix it up and keep it working. But eventually it's going to die, and I wouldn't pay premium price for it. The same with this game. For that reason it's taking an additional hit on the overall score I would give it. This game is not a $60 game plain and simple. It's an expansion pack. While I do consider games art, I also factor in value. Modern Warfare 3 doesn't deliver on either front.Also, this isn't about BF3 vs. MW3. Modern Warfare 3 is bad REGARDLESS of Battlefield 3. Not because of it. It's just a game that falls on the higher side of poor.",GeneticBlueprin
212135,Halo 5: Guardians,XboxOne,0,I've been playing this game on and off over the past year and I think I'm just done with it.The single player campaign is an awful nonsensical story that's completely forgettable. That's all that could be said about that portion but it's so much worse: Boring AI squadmates and shifting perspectives to uninteresting personalities are really what kill it. Halo 2 did this well and made itI've been playing this game on and off over the past year and I think I'm just done with it.The single player campaign is an awful nonsensical story that's completely forgettable. That's all that could be said about that portion but it's so much worse: Boring AI squadmates and shifting perspectives to uninteresting personalities are really what kill it. Halo 2 did this well and made it work because the Arbiter was an interesting character. The sangheli were an interesting race. And the Covenant is an interesting faction. Locke offers absolutely NONE of that so why force him down our throats? Start a spin off with Locke if you want to tell his story so bad. People play the SP campaign of Halo to play as Master Chief and have him interact with crazy alien objects in exotic locales. Unfortunately that's only a small portion of the campaign here.The multiplayer has several exploits that make it frustrating. Some items and weapons are way overpowered. Requisition/lootboxes add a pay to win aspect that just makes it no fun especially since they keep adding more and more common/uncommon items making it even harder to unlock the rarer ones. So people can just pay hand over fist and keep unlocking overpowered weapons and items. Even the way the permanent unlocks work makes you suffer. I had to unlock like 100 different assault rifles and battle rifles that barely vary at all before I unlocked something I was excited to use. And the UI for scrolling through these items? AWFUL. There's 100 items but only five at a time fit on the screen. Are you kidding me? Christ.,GeneticBlueprin
156573,Batman: Arkham Knight,PlayStation4,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        After reading all of the negative reviews, I can sum all of them up with one simple word, WHINERS. Everything they're complaining about makes no sense and leads me to wonder how much the game they actually played thus far. Nearly all of the rants are about the smallest insignificant details or they're simply asking for too much. They're like Yelp reviews who give restaurants 1 star for not giving them water within 2 minutes of sitting down.Now, for a more honest review...The good:-Improved graphics: Graphics are definitely next generation quality with improved textures and backgrounds. Watching the waves in the water was mesmerizing in itself. The new Batsuit was one of the best additions and it also got rid of the underwear on the outside look too and seems so much more tactical.-Expanded cityscape: Gotham just got more interesting now that it's an actual city. You got the financial district that is Founder's Island, it's own Chinatown and other little tidbits like a downtown reminiscent of Times Square.-Batmobile action: It's basically a tank which makes sense. Batman needs fire power and driving this thing around is awesome. The funniest thing is that if you're ever cornered on the street or just come across people you don't want to fight, call the batmobile and you can just incapacitate them.-Side missions: So much more to do than just Riddle missions. Stopping TwoFace and Penguin along with other villains like Firefly and Deathstroke-Overall storyline: Good story with Scarecrow unleashing a massive attack on Gotham. It's suspenseful and chaotic as Batman traverses the city to stop him. Some of it is pretty predictable but this isn't a Dan Brown novel. It's a Batman video game.The bad:-Identity of Arkham Knight: SPOILER ALERT!!!!! This was arguably the biggest disappointment in the game. When they first announced this character, everyone speculated it being Jason Todd but since Rocksteady stressed 'original' character we figured it wouldn't be. That was until you fight him a low and behold, it is essentially the Under the Red Hood Storyline. Just slightly altered where Todd is manipulated to hate Batman instead.-Platform issues: PC got the short-end on this whole ordeal.-Saving: I wasn't a fan of the saving process in this game. The only time the game would save was if there was progress being made in the game which makes sense but sometimes, after finishing a mission I'd just explore a bit and not complete anything and when I go to quit the game will warn me about when I last save but won't give me an option to save before quitting. Basically, saving is relied on completing a mission/objective which i found to be quite annoying.-Playable characters: Even though Nightwing and Robin are in this game, we can't play with these characters for extended period of time. If Batman happens to team up with his partner, then we can switch to them during fights but that's it. They also work it into the story where Batman constantly refuses help from his counterparts as well which is even more annoying. Why there weren't more 'team' missions when you have these characters doesn't make sense. It's like a tease.-Batsuits: One thing the last Arkham game got right was being able to explore the batcave and all that came with it. While Batman doesn't has a few more remote bases like the clocktower and the Wayne Tower, you can't really change suits or anything like that within the game and you have to exit the game in order to do so. Not cool.Overall, with the amount of content it has, it's worth the full price.",edwadokun
161331,Diablo III: Reaper of Souls,PC,7,"A vast improvement from the first iteration of Diablo 3. However, when compared to Diablo 2's expansion, Lord of Destruction, this is nothing more than a glorified DLC.

The first being KHI. I loved the way that it brought back some old worlds and also brought in some amazing new ones like Pride Rock and the Land of Dragons. One of the things I didn't like was that the Olympus Colosseum games were moved to the Underworld which in my opinion took the feel out of that world. Also, there was no Traverse Town. I don't mean that the world should have came back, I just wanted a hub world. I know that Hollow Bastion was supposed to be that but it again didn't have the same feel to it and I didn't visit that world unless the game took me there. Another thing is that there was no real plot. In KH1, Sora was looking for his friends, in KHCOM pm he was looking for Namine but on the second one, I had no idea. However, again I loved the new world additions especially Port Royal but if in KH3 is like KH2, then I won't be rushing out to but a Playstation 3",Tgopher

Unfortunately, while the story and graphics were amazing, the fighting was great, I simply could not get my head around some of the changes from the old final fantasy elements.Turning summons into (for lack of a better word) mounts was ridiculous, and many boss fights were just pointless. Unless you were a longtime FF fan and knew how to defeat certain types of enemies, the only way to defeat some enemies was grinding levels and hoping for the best.While i HAD to play it because of it being part of the FF series, I would not suggest this game to anyone looking for a reminder of past Final Fantasies.",Hikaru

16938,Mass Effect 2,Xbox360,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This review will be very difficult because I want to give this game a 10 out of 10 so badly! It is honestly one of, if not the best game I have ever bought. Initially I bought the original ME because I heard about the importing characters, and that concept was so cool that it just dragged me in. The concept itself was done almost flawlessly. I am now more connected to this character than any other because my decisions over games will shape the way the final battle is fought. The only issue is for newcomers for the 360, you are not given a choice, you have all of the renegade options chosen for you from the start so it is hard to jump into the second game as a paragon. As for gameplay, I didn't mind that they dumbed it down. The first one had more depth, but that depth caused it to become a cluttered mess. Now, what bioware excells at is story and the idea of a power trying to destroy the universe is not the most creative, but they add twists like what happens to the species before that make you sit back and say ""Woah!"" The other characters around you are done amazingly. Everything that makes them who they are is explained through dialog giving them depth aside from being ""green assassin"" or ""blue biotic"". Not only the new characters but the fact that some characters return makes you as much attached to them as some real life people. You become cautious at the idea that these people that have fought beside you for so long could die, and you become sensitive to their way of thinking so you do not upset them and so you can gain their loyalty. I have played no other game that I feel as strongly about, and I can only hope the 3rd is another improvment but let's me keep the all stars of my crew.Mining still sucks, so....",pointydagger

As you progress you see longer transitions between puzzles that try to be puzzles themselves but are really just a test of your observational abilities as you search for a far off wall that allows for portals. Another point is that after every puzzle there is a loading screen. This made sense for portal 1 because it was forced beside 4 other games in the orange box, but portal 2makes these loadings seem unexplainable. Luckly, the loads are in a spot that seem natural and do not affect gameplay. This review was only for singleplayer. Multiplayer looks to be more of the same but you are more limited trying to find a friend who has not played it before you lest you lose the ability to figure out the puzzles yourself, but I am satisfied with the single experience alone, so it is worth reviewing alone, though I cannot wait to try coop puzzles.",pointydagger

Single player was okay, though the fact that they brought back the infinite enemies until you advance thing was an unwelcome surprise. The story was short and predictable, but I didn't buy this game for the story. This brings me to the mutiplayer, which is so broken that it is hard to play it. There is no spawn system to speak of. Mw2 at least tried to spawn you where enemies weren't looking, but black ops has shown many times that such concerns such as spawning in front of an enemy of having the enemy you just killed spawn with you in their sights are not important. Maps are not varied at all. There are barely any maps that sniping can be used effectivly on besides quickscoping, which they failed to stop. On top of that, every player has an obsession with the two smallest maps. You will never see nuketown or firing range go withoutthe majority vote if either are an option, whch is puzzilng because they are not great maps bby any stretch of the imagination. The best things about this game are theatre, zombies, and combat training, but even these have issues. Theatre will sometimes cut the matches short, there is only 1 zombies map, and I will not spend 20 dollars for new ones when I spent more than enough for the game itself, and combattraining doesn't work offline for some strange reason though it is only me and some bots. I am not a **** sniper camper as my refiew might make me out to be, I am just a player that has bought 4 cod games and whatched them reach their height only to decline in the last 3 and now I think it is a game to see how bad they can make this franchise and still get sales.",pointydagger

Some parts are a little fluffed up, but you at least want to stay on board to find out what will happen next, and how it will end. 5th, The controls were unintuitive. So, I remapped them, but they still didn't feel quite right. Finally, I opted to use an XBOX360 controller. For me, this is an unfortunate and unnecessary weak spot, because the PC version of a game should work well with a  mouse and keyboard.

I give the story pacing a very good 9/10, the only reason why it didn't get 10/10 is because it felt rushed at the last minute. Then the character development is extremely good for a game. You fell for Max and you want him to win, ironically he doesn't all the time which makes for good plot twist often very depressing. I would give characters and character development a 10/10 and plot 10/10, both did really well because of how serious the game felt without being like a soap opera, with the terrible acting and stupid plot twist. Then the multiplayer is really good too. I mean it is really balanced and gang wars is interesting and alot of replyability and bullet time. The only thing holding it back is that leveling up can sometimes feel like a long time.  Now the only thing that is really drops the score for me is character mobility. Now i decided to score this because of two reasons. One is that they had a huge budget to spend and it is a linear game to details like this can often make or break a linear game. Two is because it is very important aspect because max Payne is a hard game, and often cover to cover is the only way to survive especially in multiplayer. Now i know in campaign Max isn't some Ezio and he can't really do parkour or barrel rolls with ease or anything like that but when it comes to multiplayer it feels like my guy no matter how heavy or like he/she is, it still feels like a big tank and somewhat slow which feels very awkward, and at times it feels like my avatar just ate 3 big macs with large fries. So unfortunately because of multiplayer character control i have to give character feel a 6/10. Its good in campaign but in multiplayer it can be really frustrating.

First off you will see that it is open world strait off the bat, and you will also notice that the enviornments are beautiful and diverse. Then one thing is that multiplayer is much better aswell, i can actually find a match and the whole storefront has been streamlined to make it much easier to get what you need and go on. And another thing that really didn't need improvement is the car sounds, yet they made them even better. Now a Diablo sounds really close to the actually, the only difference is that a real one would be too loud for the game to handle. And one thing that i like the most is that they made the game much more challenging and less restrictive on what you want to drive, the AI is really, really hard on the highest difficulty, compare that to Forza 4 where even i could get 3rd with the AI on hard and all assist off. The only problem with this game i that the world is too small, in comparrison to TDU1 and TDU2, luckly Horizan beats the TDU series on every other level. And i guess another minor problem is that the car crash physics are the worse since FM1, and the rollover physics, sadly this is because GRID set that bar so high for me i really don't see FM getting to that level. Though a major problem i still run into is that the game as a whole is still a little to easy. I already have 700k and i don't know how to spend it, i never feel the urge to tune a car unless for the fun of it, never for making it easier to win. Sum it up Pros:Streamlined online, harder then FM4, enviornments, and very fun to explore. Cons:Still fairly easy, outdated crashes. Overall i give it a solid 8/10.",McCully243
210862,Battlefield 3,Xbox360,10,"Ok i have given Dice sometime now it is time to review BF3. Ok i am not not going to be baised at all  with this review like some of these people who gave this a 10 or a 1 i guess you can say the outliers. Now being a primarly multiplayer game i will first review the multiplayer first off. Ok the multiplayer isn't as good as BC2 first off. This is because the fact that not even half of theOk i have given Dice sometime now it is time to review BF3. Ok i am not not going to be baised at all  with this review like some of these people who gave this a 10 or a 1 i guess you can say the outliers. Now being a primarly multiplayer game i will first review the multiplayer first off. Ok the multiplayer isn't as good as BC2 first off. This is because the fact that not even half of the enviornment is completely destructable and that it feels a like they added what i like to call pointless stuff. One of them is the attachments which sometimes i get really confused with. Some examples are bibods for carbines, that is stupid in a sense that carbine don't usaually don't have that much reacoil and that they don't have that much distance which is one of the perks of bibod to do. Another example for specifically carbines is the dlc guns have the zoom by 6 scope which is really pointless because they don't have power at the distance. Now because that you don't have to choose those attachments its not going to bring down the multiplayer score that much. One thing that really brougt it down for me was the destruction. This is not only because it was a huge part of BC2 that i loved and kept the replayability but the tactics. Now its really wierd distruction in BF3 the things you can destroy are mostly pointless like in Grand Bazaar you can blow a hole in the wall down the long hall to the second checkpoints. I find that stupid because nobody is going to be behind that wall before you blow it up. But then you can't fully destrory the building where there could multiple enemies. Now i am not only talking about this map in particular but most maps in BF3 are that way. Now the leveling system too is not as good as BC2 it doesn't feel like i choose a class because of helping the team but to get that next cononel service star for that class and i think they should of made the levels longer until you reach cononel this is because reaching cononel should feel like you worked really hard to get there but not that feeling because everyone else is a cononel now you have this unlock limbo where the game expects you to do that agian 100 times to reach max level with no unlocks. i think thats why they should of worked on this a little make it feel special that you got to that level. Now because of these two main reasons, i will give the multiplayer a 7/10. It was fun and some maps were good but it just didn't live up to the hype of what it was suppose to be.  Now we get into the campaign, and it is really bad. I think of a campaign like a story and a gameplay style close to multiplayer. Sadly BF3 does not deliever on either of these. First off the characters and character developement are terrible, honestly i would care if my guy at the end got his head blown off by the terrorist trying to bomb the metro. This same goes for the other characters, i honestly didn't care that two guys were killed when i was invading the mansion or when dimitris friend was impaled by a pole. The reason why i didn't care is because of that nobody felt like they had a personality they all felt like 2D characters in a Michael Bay movie. Then the oddest thing from a multiplayer game open world to have a very linear Single player to the point of where if you walk a couple of feet away you get a mission fail. Though even with these faults single player fighting can be fun with the chance of being melee killed make for some suspense and the graphics look better then multiplayers. Overall though the single player is a 3/10. Now what dice prides itself is the graphics and sound. Sound is really cool now i haven't shot these caliber of guns before but i do know that even in BC2 they recorded the gun sounds with real guns with real ammo, obviously though down a range but still really good effort in sound. Sound is without a doubt a 10/10. And the graphics are good at times. Its sometimes low resolution at distance. But with weather effects and lighting it can be really good. So overall graphics is a 8/10. Not the best but definatly above average. Now the content is ok but it isn't as good as amount of CoD did especially when it comes to Co-op. This is why i was holding off a real review at first because i thought that Co-op would get a few maps from DLC. But alas that hasn't happened yet and its been out for 8 months. Now the multiplayer content is good you get tons of attachments though some of them are pointless you get a good amount. Also the amount of maps and guns themselfs will increase over time. But then it comes to story and this is where it falls. Overall though not a bad game just a game that was obviously a test for Frostbite 2. And it needs alot of work to be as good as BC2 was Overall this game recieves a 28/40 or a 7/10.",McCully243

The issue I have is that the main story isn't all that interesting. While some of the twists were impressive, I left the game not feeling the same attachment to characters that I did in Fallout 3. The ending was pretty anti-climatic as well, (although I guess that also applies to Fallout 3).The mechanics are improved quite a bit and the improved map system and opening items system really made this game a lot more accessible than Fallout 3.

Over the last decade, Halo has been one of the most successful franchises in gaming history, providing the XBOX with a killer app and itself becoming a cultural phenomenon. However, with the Halo trilogy done, and as the fan base knows what happens toIn the beginning, you know the end.These are the words Bungie have used to market Halo Reach and nothing could be closer to the truth. Over the last decade, Halo has been one of the most successful franchises in gaming history, providing the XBOX with a killer app and itself becoming a cultural phenomenon. However, with the Halo trilogy done, and as the fan base knows what happens to Reach, it was imperative that a deeper story would be needed that extended the Reach narrative.Enter Noble Team. An elite group of six Spartan soldiers located on Reach tasked with a mission to investigate the 'Visegrad Relay'. You play as Noble Six, a replacement Spartan for the others 'missing in action'. The first thing you will notice about the game is the improvement to the graphics. The engine has been completed overhauled and with smoother animation, this is easily the most technically impressive Halo yet. The artistic design is phenomenal, with Reach itself becoming a central character in the game with amazing vistas and variety.Althought the campaign is only 9 missions long, there is enought variety in terms of levels and scenarios to make this a valid purchase. Each mission, on Legendary, can take over an hour to complete.So, I've given Halo Reach a 9. What makes Halo Reach good?After completing the campaign, I had to admit I was a little dissapointed. I played the campaign on 'Heroic' difficulty and managed to complete it in a day. I had my own expectations of what I wanted to get from Halo Reach that I didn't get from this. But, in hindsight and after going back to the game with a clear head, Halo Reach is a brilliant piece of software.The campaign is incredibly varied. To go into too much detail enters 'spoiler territory' but the level 'Last Night in Solace' is my favourite Halo campaign mission ever. (Note: the mission shown in the E3 reveal!). Bungie have upted the action meter with a lot of background going on. Reach is being attacked by the Covenant and it feels like it. You will see battles in the skies and distance and there is a genuine feel of a constant threat around you trying to take your planet.The campaign does have it's shortcomings which I noticed more from playing on the 'Legendary' difficulty. The artificial intelligence. I had issues of Brutes walking past about seven marines to come for me, which completely killed the atmosphere. Likewise, the marines didn't fire shots. The marines are terrible at driving warthogs, always sending you in the line of fire (Legendary, that means death!) and concentrating fire on the wrong targets. Frustrating. I also noticed on the hardest difficulty the weapons seem to be unbalanced. It takes a silly amount of amunition to take down the smallest of targets and I feel Bungie should have relied more on 'armor upgrades' or 'tactics' to improve the difficulty rather than something as cheap as 'it will take 3 times as more shots to kill me'. An example is Ghost vs Ghost on Legendary you will always lose, even if you had the upper hand. Basically, the CPU cheats to make it difficult, which it still isn't, suprisingly. Another example is Elites dual-weilding plasma rifles, which you cannot do.Despite these shortcomings, Halo Reach does have some impressive campaign sleeves up it's belt. 'Armor abilities'. You'd think these would be game-breaking but infact, they are my new favourite additions to Halo. Armor abilities allow you to perform certain actions which now provides a new tactical edge to gameplay. The 'Hologram' is incredibly useful and hilarious in multiplayer as well as 'Armor Lock' which stops Online Vehicle Killing Sprees...finally.There are so many posotives to the Halo Reach package. Outside the campaign, there is a new CR system to purchase armor upgrades which are reflected in game and a new way of levelling up. It's a shame this was not expanded into other territories but I suppose that is what DLC is for. Forge has been expanded to include a 'map-editing' feature known as 'Forge World'. You cannot amend the geometry of the level but you can add items and structures. Firefight, from ODST, is included with several other gamnetypes such as 'Arena, Score Attack' which provide a large online package.The story of Halo Reach is well paced, but I wish there was a deeper narrative to develop a relationship with your fellow Spartans. I liked the fact that, despite everything going on, you were not the central character, the planet itself was. In the latter parts of the game, you are tasked with missions that are not exactly stereotypically 'end of game' missions but make you feel small and disposable, which is what you are in the jist of things.So, in conclusion, Halo Reach is a fantastic product. The campaign, on it's own scores at least an 8 with the other packages available pushing this to a nine. Play it on Heroic, you'll enjoy it and try legendary once you fancy a challenge.

You play as Cole Phelps, a former war hero turned LAPD cop who is trying to move on with his life after the war. The game is set in Los Angeles, California in 1947. The most famous aspect of L.A Noire is the 'MotionScan' technology. Actors play out the scenes and every movement is motion captured and placed in the game. The result is a truly engaging detective experience where body language and facial expressions are a key tool to cracking the case. L.A Noire is a game which wouldn't have been possible without this technology.L.A Noire's gameplay is made up of 4 scenarios. Driving around LA to cases, investigating the evidence at the crime scene, interrogating witnesses and suspects and car chases/on foot chases. Many people will say the game is linear, but it honestly is not. Because of the nature of the game, every case is unique, which can't be said for Grand Theft Auto.Although a lot of people will be impressed with the content of this game, some aspects of L.A Noire has been done before. Searching for clues, investigating items and keeping a notebook record was done in 2000 by Shenmue but L.A Noire does it FAR better and expands on it. Phelp's notebook keeps a log of 'People of Interest', 'Locations' and 'Clues' relating to a case. If you join the Social Club, you can use intuition points which are earned by ranking up, to remove an answer for an interrogation, ask the community or show all the clues.That said, L.A Noire expands on these concepts, puts them in a narrative that they fit and provides an engaging story and experience which you shouldn't miss.Buy it!!",FeelinLuckyPUNK

Created by famed developer Remedy, responsible for gems such as Max Payne, Alan Wake is a psychological thriller about a writer called Alan Wake who takes a much needed holiday with his wife to Bright Falls. As soon as they arrive, nothing goes to plan, his wife is kidnapped by a mysterious force known as the Darkness and Alan brings it upon himself to discover her whereabouts.The game was originally conceived as an open world, sandbox title and I was a little disappointed upon release when it was revealed that this had been taken out. The game takes place as episodes like a tv series with daytime being your story progression and night-time being the action orientated fight against the Taken, the name given to the people who have been overcome by the Darkness. This, ruined one of the strongest appeals for me. I had envisaged taken my car out for a drive to suddenly being overcome by the Darkness, with light the only source of comfort.But Alan Wake is good, but not great. The daytime sequences only exist to expand the narrative and provide a sense of a believeable open world which in fact is quite linear. The night is the main bulk of the game and is where Alan Wake's story lies. Armed with only a torch and a few weapons, Alan must traverse a variety of woodland environments to meet his objectives to try to find his wife, Alice. The environments are incredibly spooky and the game is very atmospheric but unfortunately it is just not scary. I played the game on the 'Normal' setting and this is what most people will play and the game constantly tells you when the Taken are going to ambush you, defeating the element of suprise. I don't know if this can be turned off.Despite this, the game is still an enjoyable experience. I think, had the game not spent so much time in development, then it would be getting 9's across the board.The only other negative is the story. The story is good but incredibly confusing if you don't analyse everything. About half way through I didn't really have a clue what was going on!However, in an industry saturated with 'space marine shooters', Alan Wake is a refreshing change. It's not a masterpiece but it is a brilliant experience not to be missed.FeelinLuckyPUNK",FeelinLuckyPUNK

Now, there are many games that do that, but in Isaac, the game allows you to combine anything with everything. You might get a couple of powerups that seem next to useless or even annoying - but when you combine them with one powerful thing, you get some ultra-power combination.The sheer amount of content is awesome. I counted 44 different main enemy types, with each having 1-7 subtypes making it over 150 different creatures you can encounter in the game. And then you should add bosses to that.You can play the game for 100 times, and each new run would still feel fresh. It's one of the best roguelike games out there.",peterjson

AUnfortunately follows the pattern BioWare set up with Mass Effect of one cool game with a lot of promise and a few kinks, one awesome game that blows your socks off, and a third sequel that leaves you wishing they hadn't bothered. The interface for the PC version is atrocious, I was constantly battling the camera. Tactical camera is a joke compared to earlier iterations in this series. A huge chunk of the new NPCs (once a Bioware cornerstone - remember HK-47?) are so annoying I found myself partying up with a half-full roster just to have them out of my hair (some rise to being merely ok, some are particularly loathsome - Sera feels like handholding a particularly bratty 14 year old Cockney moppet throughout). The returning faces from earlier in the series are as cool as they were, but AI glitches mar their usefulness in combat (why would Varrick armed with his Bianca constantly be running up to blast away at people at point-black range, even when he had a clear line of fire?).The maps are bigger and have more secrets to find, but the way they're put together and interacted with is still primitive, and possibly constrained by this being a poor-quality console port. I can't think of any other reason for the multi-level Val Royeaux marketplace to be chopped up into 10 different, tiny quadrants that have to be fast-traveled between - either a limitation of how much can be rendered within the console version's constraints or a bafflingly poor design choice. Other games in this genre - Skyrim, the Witcher series, etc - have done far better and looked far better doing it.Combat is a meh affair where, in addition to fighting the camera, you will often be fighting your own party members' AIs. There are some tweaks you can do to have them prefer, disallow or use normally their powers while under AI control, but often when you give them orders in tactical view they will simply disregard them and do whatever they want. This is especially frustrating with the protagonist while engaging in rift battles - you may leave him or her covered and give them the command to work their magic MacGuffin on the rift to seal/weaken it, then look back moments later and find out they decided to run around or fight some random mob nearby instead. Bioware billed Inquisition as the triumphant return of tactical view that had been missing from II, but what they dredged back up is a flawed and creaking shadow of what once was.The overarching plot is... okay, not great. The pacing is extremely offputting, particularly towards the end and around the Hinterlands portion, as many reviews have noted. It's not as compelling as Origins or II by a long shot, however.I haven't mentioned multiplayer because I haven't bothered to play it - after the lackluster singleplayer showing it seemed pretty pointless.Long story short - like ME3, this game seems to be Bioware so up themselves about their craft that they completely forgot to put in the heart and good character writing that they were once known for. Probably the last of their RPGs I'll buy; there are better choices on the market these days. Save your money, pick up the new Witcher for something that will out-Bioware Bioware, or Divinity Original Sin for something more retro, indie, and silly/funny.",Apethae

This would be cheesey IF itOne of the better games to come out in a very long time, every little thing in this game is perfect to me. The story itself is simple: you come to a cursed land (for whatever reason, one of the things the NPC says ""Whether you're here to fight the demons or here for the power..."") and you're tasked to fight off the major demon's in the land to fight off the fog. This would be cheesey IF it were portrayed cheesey. It is not full of itself (like a Final Fantasy game would be) and barely touches the main storyline. It has a dark setting to it, already making you feel weak from the start, therefore giving you the right idea from the start. The combat is very smooth and can be mastered with a little play (I say past 3 levels you should get the hang of it). The combat itself is not extremely hard, all you have to do is just dodge/block and you'll be fine. If you get hit, you will regret being hit (that is all I will say). The leveling system is very good in my opinion, but the only downside to it is that you have to plan on what you're focusing on or you'll screw up your character and not be able to equip certain items (or at least use them the way you want to). If you do screw up your character, the worst part of starting a new character is the creation. It has a very high replay value and I would be ok with just making a new character everyday. The every NPC is unique in their own way. Doing certain things will trigger new dialogue with the NPCs and helps you learn more of the land of Boletaria. When you enter 5-1, come back, and talk with the NPCs, they will share you their thoughts on Maiden Astraea and Garl Vinland (the final bosses of the 5 world), explaining how the fog clouded their souls and why they fight. Even some of the item descriptions have captured me, letting me now of it's previous owner/maker. The multiplayer design is absolutely brilliant. After 1-1, you can use three different stones: Blue stone (used when in soul form, allows yourself to be teleported to another persons world (if they accept your soul sign) and assist them, to which beating a boss gives you back your body, given after 1-1), Black stone (used when in another person's world, lets you go back to your own world, given after 1-1), and the Red stone (used when in soul form, you teleport yourself to another person's world (at free will) and you attempt to kill the person to gain your body back). So whether you feel like helping somebody or want to be a complete ass and kill somebody, they have allowed you to accomplish both in this game in a very easy and quick (I can't say quick for the blue stone though) way. All in all, a game that everyone should buy and play before Dark Souls release.",MrFpeas

The beginning was beautiful and wonderful, don't get me wrong. The story, setting, characters, and map design felt fresh and great to play in. The combat has gotten more difficult, which I like to see in games (considering how many games like to go easy on players these days). However, I was not a fan of the potion-usage in the Witcher 2. In fact, I still question what was wrong with just keeping the Witcher 1's potion usage. Did they feel like being able to use your potion whenever was wrong? Unless I missed something, you could only use your potion when meditating, but it's a matter of opinons. When I entered the city in Chapter 3 (I believe), something felt off. It really did not feel like there was much to do and there really wasn't. The main quest line was a breeze and the dragon fight felt a little unsatisfying to me, it honest to god did not felt like I fought a dragon. And then in the epilogue, I did not like how they decided to have the bad guy (forgot his name, sorry) answer all your questions right there and then, instead of answering the questions slowly. He had at least 25 things to say (if you decided to listen) and I was sitting there wondering ""Why couldn't they just answer some of these things over the game, not at once."" And the ending was just so bland, it really had no meaning. The Witcher 1's ending was very intense and very story-compelling to me, they gave you a very good reason why the bad guy's were doing what they did. In the Witcher 2, the bad guy assassinated kings, which sparked off revolts, just because the king in the south caught him and said ""I will start a new Witcher academy if you kill the king"". Felt cliche and bland to me. To sum it up for any ""tl;dr"" people. First half of the game: Witcher 2>Witcher 1. Ending chapters of the game: Witcher 1 >>>>>>>>>> Witcher 2. Let's hope in the Witcher 3 that they can ultimately conclude this game series with a very interesting and mind-twisting ending.",MrFpeas
167131,Bastion,PC,10,"This is one of the greatest games I've had the honor of playing in a very long time.

The story, even though basic by itself, is engulfed with many themes and little details if you actually pay attention, which helps set up the mood and background of the world itself. The game actually has very little cutscenes actually, which is such a great pace changer compared every other game these days, and is told by a new and amazing voice actor, who already got another job for another indie game that recently came out (can't recall the name of it right now, but it's a point-and-click game where you control 4 character simultaneously).  Yes, even though everything is told by this one narrator, he very much does accomplish this goal very well, I promise you.The gameplay itself follows (the best way to put it) a Diablo-like style, however, you get plenty of weapons to actually mix and match around with, as well as skills accordingly (some skills you can choose by the weapons you equip). Instead of following a stat sheet, whenever you level up, you get to choose these drinks that help buff you up (10% crit. chance while at 100% health, etc). To also increase difficulty, there is a ""shrine"" in the game (first found on a level, then you can build later on in the Bastion), where you can make enemies difficult (in various ways) and you will benefit by an increase of money and experience.   The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a videogame, and it shouldn't be a surprise that half it's awards (it has plenty of awards fyi) is about it's soundtrack. Memorable songs, very sleek music, and the ending theme will help give you goosebumps and give the ending the mood it deserved. The sounds themselves are very good, nothing sounds (no pun intended) out of place or anything.I can't essentially say much about the graphics 'itself', but the artstyle is definitely refreshing. Even though this game actually is a very bittersweet game, the artstyle does not hinder it at all. If there's one game that can prove that you DON'T need grimdark, brown'n'bloom graphics to set up a dark mood, it's Bastion.To wrap things up, I'll give a quick talk about the ending (no essential spoilers). This is where the beauty comes in. You make two decisions (one right before the end and at the very end). And I can tell you: there really is no good/bad answer. The decisions you have to choose are right and wrong in their own ways, and this really leads back to themes I was talking about. I don't want to talk about it too much or else I might ruin the story and the mood for you (I tend to do that sadly), but it definitely should leave you questioning about your own real life decisions (especially if you're a teenager). Supergiant Games says they want you to feel like a kid again when playing their games. And they accomplished that with me. That is why I am giving this game a 10. I have yet to play a game that made me feel a kid again and they did it with this one. Yes, it is a grim game essentially, but the artstyle and music at times just makes you feel like you're playing one of those old games you use to play a lot when you were a kid. It's as simple as that. And with that, I will gladly give this game a 10/10. I am looking forward to Supergiant's next game, as I hope many of you are too.",MrFpeas

This has the multiplayer that the current CoD games should have sticked with. Instead of grinding your profile in order to get better weapons, all the weapons are available to you right from the start, each having their ups and downs, but a very balanced set of weapons so that you don't have to worry about a overpowered weapon (which happens a lot in the current CoD games). The original maps were very well layed out, making camping a lot less viable than in the current CoD games. Though this game is very old and not many play this anymore, I decided it would be right to write a review of my favorite CoD game and hope the best that they can bring back the way multiplayer used to be.

Also abuse of enemies that remove the floor, which ends in one-hit kills too. At the end of the day, in most bosses the player's Life bar doesn't mean anything as they'll mostly die falling or by a spike.- The kickstarter elements (extra bosses, the castle of portraits) are ""shoved in"" without any type of theming, they seem very out of place and don't add any value.- Items make the game very very easy.

Anyway, Birthright still abuses of those objectives, but Conquest and, from what I've seen Revelations, do a better job at this.Story-wise, the game is a little step down from Awakening, even when that game didn't have a stellar writing. Child units made sense in Awakening and were an epic thing (children going back to the past to save their parents). In this game it doesn't make sense: they have a child and put it in the Dragon Ball Z training room, and then they come out all grown up.However, I find characters are lovable (design and personality-wise).The worst thing about the game is in fact the localisation. The game is heavily censored and it shows even if you didn't know about the fiasco. I've even made a test by showing conversations to people who don't know about this game, and they felt they were ""off"".English only audio would not be a problem if the dub wasn't so, SO BAD.

The ony thing I miss from any of the previous games is the animals; while there are a few, there are not as many as in MGS3, but this can be expected. There are other minor details that could've been clearer, but then the game would've taken another year, and the extra dwelling time for the developers and gamers would've only damaged the title further. Also, the Mission Briefing and Act screens are a little lame. I can't really say much about what makes the game good, because then I'll ruin it for any who have not played it.",MarkD.
71073,Final Fantasy VII,PlayStation,8," I can appreciate this games ground breaking plot, graphics, characters, the fact that it brought games and movies that bit closer and made RPGs cool yet i still gave up half way through.

100290,Forza Motorsport 2,Xbox360,9," Seems to me most of the complaints about the physics are done by folks who have obviously never driven a real car on a real track -- hate to tell you, but if you don't enter the corner at the right angle and speed, you WILL find yourself into the sand, grass or, worse yet, wall. So ... having played every version of Gran Turismo, I have to see Forza is incredibly impressive.

So ... having played every version of Gran Turismo, I have to see Forza is incredibly impressive. Much like GT, it's a tribute to cars that's meant to appeal to us autophiles, not 13-year olds who like the arcade-style found in games like Burnout or Need for Speed. The choice of cars is excellent (still too few Mustangs, IMHO), the tracks challenging and interesting, the graphics great, and the ability to modify the look of the cars is a HUGE advantage of GT (again, IMHO). The only thing keeping this game from getting a 10 is the soundtrack -- a few good tunes, but I love to jam out while driving. Thus, I recommend loading up your iPod with some great driving tunes, playing it just loud enough to hear the music while still being able to hear the car's exhaust and tires. Do that, and this is driving nirvana for those of us who truly understand cars and what it takes to race them.",MarkD.

The charector progression, and multiple skill trees are fun, and you get better at using a particular weapon type the more you use the weapon type.  I loved thinning out the mobs by popping head shots with a elemental sniper rifle from afar, and then going in, and cleaning up with an machine gun or automatic hand gun.  Getting close to mobs using Liliths Pheonix skill is a riot too, especially in zombie land.  Im a little more methodical than other players though.  Some people Ive played with like to just wade in with a shot gun, or rocket launcher.  There's also vehicle battles, and a thunderdome style arena where you have a ton of mobs thrown at you at once, under many different conditions, such as low gravity, faster speeds, or using specific weapon types for more, or less damage.  Borderlands is simply one of those games just about anyone will love-trust me!

After that amazing intro, i could never imagine how boring and repetitive it would get.Boring because of the completely nonsensical plot and back story, lame villains and the disappointing boss battles, specially the first one with Sahelanthropus, they really took a dump on the game with this one:-Snake is infiltrated in a high security military base filled with soldiers, war tanks and war helicopters.-If you decide to escape the base without the walker machine, Snake is on feet, carrying a crippled prisoner plus all those weapons.-""Skull face"" somehow knows about it, he could command all the soldiers in the base to kill Snake easily, but instead, he decides to make Snake a surprise on his exit and show him Sahelanthropus for like no reason at all.-From one second to another, all the soldiers in the military base just vanished, the high security military base is total empty and simply abandoned now, forget about them, it is only Snake and Sahelanthropus now. (the same happened when you are about to secure the remains of the man on fire)-Sahelanthropus with all its power and greatness is unable of killing Snake, even if he is standing right in front of it at a open field and a clear shot vision.-Snake escapes Sahelanthropus and the military base on feet, uncovered and carrying all those weapons plus a crippled prisoner on his back.-Snake calls the helicopter to pick him up in a place where Sahelanthropus can see.-Sahelanthropus is unable of taking down a chopper.-Snake gets in the chopper and destroys Sahelanthropus with shots from a .50 machine gun.Seriously? Even a old war tank could handle those shots or take down the chopper but the weapon supposed to bring to world to its knees could not?About being repetitive, some people say that it is only if you play always the same time but that makes no sense at all.It is nice that i could do all the exact same missions all over again in a different way if i wanted, not that i was bound to do it anyway so i can get to the end of the game, which by the way, was cut out from it. The game has no end at all, what doesn't matter because the story is so boring that you do not have desire to know what happens next.MGS 5 begins a joke on Ground Zeroes (a game that is as short as their dicks) and ""finished"" on the Phantom Pain (japanese anime **** recycled so it looks bigger)",billyjones

In the cold winter months leading up to the release, there where alot of nay sayers about final fantasies most recent installment and some reviews that rated the game as low as 4/10, after playing I can reassure you that this game deserves nothing less then a full 10. Alot of series traditions(I.e. towns, exploration) have been cast aside in favor of a more combat focused adventure as well as a very well told and very human storyline. The fact that you cant really edit or change tho configuration of your party until relativly late doesnt aid the game, in its defense this is really a favorable allternative to losing story elements because your controling the wrong party member. Now lets talk about what everybody seems to be most bothered by, the linaerity, yes final fantasy 13 is very linear, but why is that bad? FFX was linear and it is one of the highest reviewed games in its generation, I understand fans have certain expectations but change is not always a bad thing and in this case its a phenomenal accomplishment.

I bought myself a new gaming rig right now so I could enjoy this new release in it's full glory and to hard test my new hardware.I had to wait for my new rig and for the games key until two weeks after release and read a view reviews here about it. I got to say I tend to read the negative reviews first to get an idea of what might be not so pleasant about the game. Those negative Nancys got me for quite some time and I first was grateful I did not pay extra for the game - it came with my video card.Those claimed down points were mostly grafics, controls and character development.All I can say to this is: What the **** is wrong with people?!Jesus! This brings back my personal memories of Gothic 2 where I was drawn in as a teenager for weeks.Despite my nostalgic feel I can only say this game is top notch in every aspect.Every time I launch this game I am overwhelmed by it's visual beauty - I stop often and just walk (!) through villages or with a torch in a dark forest at night to experience this great atmosphere. Just awesome. I normally do not feel the need to spend more time than necessarry in games so I fast travel or run in villages and cities but not here.Concerning the controls all I can say is that it is nothing new but far from being ""obnoxious"" or ""awful"". I am playing at the hardest difficulty which gives the game another feel of realism and authenticism since health is only restored with the potion or with food. Fights feel also a lot more challenging because blind rushing into enemies and blade flurring serves you nothing but ending dead soon after. You got to plan, you have to dodge, roll, break guards and use your signs to overcome enemies, be them beast or man.The controls always feel right to he point and accurate enough to fight tactically. Maybe the other reviewers have no talent in general for games...Last but not least the story. What are people expacting here? I may just beat 25% of the game yet but in my opinion it is a decent dark fantasy story with interesting characters and entertaining side stories.You cannot reinvent the wheel and it is no stand alone or new story beginning, it is a sequel of a series based on books. No wonder you cannot play as an old wizard killing enemies with fire bolts or a she elf archer. The protagonist is Geralt of Rivia a professional Monster slayer and swordsman. You know this before playing the game so it's no surprise you cannot create a new character or play as an archer.You either like Geralt and his style or not. End of discussion.To sum it up: One of the best games I played in my 18 years of gaming. Hands down.",uglyNobody

I am not an excessive gamer playing for hours and hours in one session - I play occasionally when I got the time.When I started Bloodborne I was hooked - it was just fun to progress through this dark, gloomy and brutal looking environment while learning the game's mechanics the hard way - trail and error. I got the first boss and was eager to proceed and excited what comes next - fine so far. Then I realized I got to grind the games currency by clearing the same streets and hallways again and a again - still fine because it was fun to improve my fighting skills while gathering the points to improve my toon and his stuff.This system worked until the first boss of the second ""chapter"" of the game - the Hemwick Witches - I got to quit after two tries because I had personal matters to attend to and then I had an odd feeling or better said - the lack of a feeling. My desire to continue was simply gone, because I realized the next morning I rather wanted to play another game I started before Bloodborne (Witcher 1, since 3 is incoming).What happened to me all of a sudden? I try to explain what it was.I realized I was playing a sneaky repetitive kind of game with beautiful optics. So the fever of love was gone and I realized what flaws this game has in my opinion. Which leads to the following pros and cons:pros:- fresh setting and beautiful design, you can see the love of the devs for optics here.- well crafted sound design fitting the scene- easy controls although many people give negative feedback herecons:- failed to keep me hooked, I do not feel the need to go on, maybe just to see how the later level and enemy designs are- limited tactics available, when you get it how do fight after some time, it becomes too easy and too repetitive even when trying to overcome hard mobs or bosses 6-7 times.- somehow useless itmes, maybe I did it wrong, but I never felt the need to use more than 1/3 of the items- NO REAL STORY, I made the mistake of reading a little spoiler. I was interested in the how and why but as you progress you never really get to know what the **** is going onconclusion:A beautiful looking game offering a solid 10-15 hours of enjoyable gameplay until the fire goes out.I do not feel guilty about spending the full price but I'd recommend to wait for an offsale if youreally want to give it a shot.Cheers!",uglyNobody

But this time the word ""tough"" needs to be replaced withwhatever suits the following:- I started playing the game on the third of the four difficulty levels, because I know the first gameand wanted an intense gameplay experience.I realized that the aim percentage you see while attacking an enemy is seemingly reduced by 15-20% because of the difficulty level. I missed four out of five shots when the percentage was between 65-80%. Long story short: no fun - executing tactics where a disaster. I perfectly flank an enemy to kill him, I miss and get kicked right away losing one of my best soldiers.- I started overs four times before I realized, I would have to lower the difficulty. Did that, enjoyed two hours of gameplay, until I went through a routine mission with the first time facing the snake like enemy. The moment one of my soldiers was grabbed and pulled to the this enemy through three walls without any line of sight was the moment I just had to quit this game and give it this review.My conclusion unfortunately is that this game is unplayable if you like a strategic challenge, because the game just does not let you execute any strategy - it just keeps kicking you in the face from out of nowhere.If you like the story and do not bother about the gameplay experience to much, then play on Rookie and go ahead.Definitely not recommended.

The introduction of new heroes is tied nicely into the stories they create and everything generally works.But when you actually spend time with it, good god can it be just an awful experience. As many people have said this is one of the worst gaming communities to date, and as you fall in rank people are only going to get worse. There are some awful examples of design, such as if your team has a leaver- all of your team will lose SR as a result, you can be matched against a 5-stack as a solo player, and some heroes are objectively better than others. There are very few matches that you'll win by a slim margin: 90% of games are going to be total wipes one way or another despite your best efforts. The worst part is that because the game is so intensely focused on the teamwork, one loose thread can throw the entire game off. While sometimes it won't be anybody's fault (often it will be though) something won't mesh in your team- whether nobody can play a hitscan to counter a flying character (of whom is massively unbalanced at lower levels) or whether nobody wants to switch despite being countered, or whether simply your chosen heroes just won't mesh together- this can end a game and all the way up to around mid-plat (over the threshold of half the playerbase)   people won't have the skill or experience to be able to play the amount of heroes necessary with the correct degree of teamwork. It's not fun, as often matches are simply decided by the roll of the matchmaker. The exception to this is anybody diamond rank or above as more people will willingly change and adapt to help the teamwork, but this only accounts for about 10-20% of the player base. A lot of these problems would be at least bearable if there was some sort of fix on the horizon, but Blizzard haven't even sought to address the blatant and easy fix of having a leaver ruin the entire team's fortunes- let alone anything that would require more thought.There's also the gripe of the game not actually having that much content for a fully priced game. While you can easily make up the hours (trying to convince yourself it's worth it), it gets very stale, very quickly as there are currently a total of 4 main game modes, with 14 maps. With all the new game modes that've come out it might be considered worth it but these are removed at the end of each event, meaning that instead of keeping the events in the game for some players to enjoy, Blizzard removes it meaning no-one gets to enjoy them. The game is also an online shooter- so the only single-player mode to speak of is playing with offline bots which is not reflective of the game at all as the bots will just stand around with only their aim tweaked to suffice for difficulty. While the online-only part is a fairly obvious part of the game, it just goes to remember that full-price games used to include both single player and online content.In short it's probably best if you don't buy Overwatch. I'll admit I was suckered in with the free weekend and the cutesy shorts, but at the end of the day the only thing you're getting is an online game that is constantly being fixed, which is at the mercy of its own community.",C100

I will agree with others that the canned missions are pretty repetative. But, the ""random"" crimes are just SO cool. I wish the entire game had been based around them. It is SOOO immersive to be doing something like looking for a secret token or something and to hear ""HELP! Someone help!!!"" and to immediately stop everything and dive off the side of the building to go help the citizen.

I found that sticking to the story missions led to the same assassinate/destroy missions BUT took me to cool locations like the Fort, Brewery, Scrap Yard, Mine, Desert Oasis, Fishing Village and more, each with a different feel. I did avoid side missions like the weapons guy and buddy missions because they were the same old but without the interesting locations, rather forcing you to traipse around the countryside. Buddy missions in particular felt like irritating strap-ons to the main mission, basically ""finish the story mission then come save my ass"". No thank you. My play style was to sneak about and snipe then wait for the enemy to come to me - if you enjoy skulking and sniping then you may well have some fun with this game. I also tended to largely avoid the roadblocks by using buses to insta-travel as well as using the map to go cross country via shortcuts that seem to be built into the game for that purpose. As an aside it should be noted that the actual plot is spectacularly retarded and if I had more of a choice I would have chosen to attack both the APR and UFLL.

The series offers a small Japanese open world, brawling fighting mechanics, and quite the mixture of side quests that ranges from helping, tracking down and engaging NPCs in interesting conversations.Yakuza 0 is a prequel to the first game and more than any other prequel out there, it does THE BEST to get you into the world of the story and establishes the characters in a very interesting way. The story is deep and interesting and is told in a very very well paced settings.The game's score is nothing short of superb. Relying if rock and Japanese instruments, the game has a set of very interesting scores that keeps getting better.I was pleased with the game, it took me a week to finish it and I never ever came close to the 100% completion mark, due to work, I couldn't spend more time.SEGA does really produce the best outta Japan.",Monokuma6677

Lets be honest, this game is the successor to two of the greatest games in the history of PC gaming. It has some monstrously huge shoes to fill and it falls completely short of even remotely comparing to its predecessors in terms of quality and replay value. No more manual designation of character stats every level, no more skill trees full of synergies and possibilities, no more mountain of exciting gem damage type/rune word combinations to experiment with. There is no longer a real sense of choice in the game. You unlock every skill as you level (only a handful of which you will ever want to use) and you can change everything about your character at the drop of the hat, thus decisions carry no weight and lack any real sense of permanence. Because of the new skill setup you will only ever make one character of any given class and he will be virtually identical to every other character of that class out there. There is absolutely no point to making a second barbarian (saving blizzard plenty of money on server storage costs no doubt). You dont take any true pride in your build because it is not a unique and clever creation like the ones you made in D2. Finally, the auction house, short acts, and horrible drop rates suck any remaining fun out the slaughter.  To all the individuals out there who are upset at seeing all these low scores, I'm sorry if this or other simliar reviews get under your skin, because I know I would be pissed if people where trashing a game I loved too.

There are some improvements in combat visuals, and the mechanics is a lot easier to handle, which attract newcomers to the DA series. But for those who enjoy the complex combat system of DA:O (I consider myself one of them) some disappointment might come from this game.The game is not a brilliant achievement in graphics (and sometimes it does disappoint, in trees, buildings and the sky) but the characters are pretty well modeled. Reusing locations is also a bad thing that must be noted.The storyline could be better, its true. This game is basically babysitting a huge city and (the final act of the game) witnessing what will be the story for DA:Inquisition.The quests are pretty entertaining, but the secondary characters can sometimes be quite forgettable.Conclusion: Dragon Age 2 is a GOOD game, but it falls short of DA:Origins.",dayman75

In my opinion, a console versionExtremely disappointing sequel to a great reboot.The original game did a lot of things right, but delved too much in oversimplification and catering to the console market. It was still a solid, balanced game, just not as good as the original.The sequel doesn't have a console version but is still commits all the sins of a rushed console port. In my opinion, a console version probably exists, but has not been released or revealed yet because it is still looking for a publisher. You should expect poor optimization (if any), a weird mouse GUI, an abundance of bugs and glitches, and overall a disgraceful PC experience not unlike most AAA releases nowadays. For all the hate Arkham Knight got, it worked better for me at release than XCom 2 does, post-patch. There is also no reason at all for the poor framerate and extremely long loading times, as the graphics are definitively outdated and arguably worse than the prequel (probably in preparation for the inevitable iPad release), yet the performance is perhaps the worst I've seen in the last few years for a PC game.So, how is the game regardless of those technical 'merits' conveniently not mentioned by any and all big-media paid-for 'reviews'? Well, unfortunately the oversimplification has been fully embraced and turned up to eleven. Now the game only accepts a single play style (what we could call 'the rushing YOLO') and will punish you severely for trying anything different. Almost every mission has a big on-screen turn timer or other kind of timed events forcing you to play in a certain way, and even the strategy world-map gameplay is a linear adventure thanks again to more timed events. The timers are deeply ingrained with the game design and balance, so unfortunately any mods trying to remove actually provide an even worse experience (and yes, I've tried them).In addition, the poorly designed RNG-based mechanics, one of the worst sins from the original, comes back with a vengeance. The combat has been tweaked in order to give way more importance to the RNG at the expense of tactical options, making the difficulty of the game essentially a random venture. Sadly, every mission is now filled with one-hit kill luck switches, including such shenanigans as having your squad leader mind-controlled by an off-screen enemy you haven't seen yet and wiping all your other teammates in a single turn (this happened to me *in the first mission* of the game). Sure, some times the RNG works in your favor, but many other times you'll miss multiple 80%+ shots in a row and get all your entire squad killed from situations that should impose no risk to you. It doesn't help when the few mechanics provided to tip the balance in your favor are introduced late in the game while the kill switches come in full force since the first mission.If you rush your way into tactic games, don't mind luck playing the biggest role in such games, and are in fact usually very lucky, you may still get some fun out of this game. But for the most part, you are better just playing the vastly superior prequel.",daragard

I love how there are a lot of extras and easter eggs. I wanted to love this game, but unfortunately, once you go past the initial presentation, the rest of the package is lacking. There is just one simple game mechanic that you will master in a few minutes, you'll finish the single player campaign in an hour or two, and the narrative doesn't add much to it other than interrupt the gameplay here and there with the usual postmodernist drivel you've come to expect from pretentious indie game designers. I hope at some point indies start caring about gameplay mechanics and content, and stop giving me unskippable high-school level dissertations about the meaning of life, complete with spelling and gramatical mistakes. But I digress.All there is here is a dozen or two of very small maps (often just a single room) where enemies respawn, often just in your face. Since both you and them die in a single hit, there is nothing else to the game. There are a set of challenges after the single player narrative where you revisit the same levels with some additional limitations that don't really change the experience by much.Although the mechanic itself is 'innovative', at the end it is just an extremely small bite-sized snack that doesn't last for more than two hours, yet it manages to be repetitive even in that little time. Given what little there is here, I find the price of admission way out of touch. This is really a $5 game at most, not much longer than a tech demo or a vertical slide.In addition, the Mac port is terrible: poor performance, a broken v-sync implementation, and not even an option to play fullscreen (Command+F works, but that is just a hidden shortcut and is not present in the game menus).",daragard

The gameplay is just as addictive as ever, though it is very hard to explain, but trust me, its a blast. The sword combat is easily the best in gaming history, by the end of each battle, my hands would be sweating. The graphics have been improved and look goregous, even better than some games on the consoles. The 3D actually does make sense here, and while it doesn't dramatically change the gameplay, it works well. This port proves that Ocarina Of Time not only holds up, but gets better every year after its release.

144663,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,PlayStation3,8,"Modern Warfare 2 was one of the most well recieved sequels in video game history, and one of the best selling. So Modern Warfare 3 has some big shoes to fill right?

The story picks up where theModern Warfare 2 was one of the most well recieved sequels in video game history, and one of the best selling. So Modern Warfare 3 has some big shoes to fill right? Well, I'm happy to report that while it certainly has its flaws (We'll get to that later) Modern Warfare 3 is a well executed, well crafted first-person shooter that is a worthy sucessor to MW2. The story picks up where the last Modern Warfare left off, after suffering defeat in their failed attempt at invading the united states the Russians launch an all out invasion of Europe. Now, members of The United States Military and Task Force 141 must find a way to prevent global armageddon. The story, while it is so convaluted (Russia could never invade the US!) it is still entertaining as hell, it provides closure for the trilogy (No cliffhanger this time) and provides for some epic cinematic set pieces. The game still runs on an excellent 60 frames per second, which adds to the silky smooth feel of the controls. You're either a fan of this gameplay by now or you're not. The campaign still features excellent variety, one moment you'll be providing cover for a squad in an AC-130 and in another you'll be tearing up enemies in a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), these stop the game from feeling repettitive and makes it fun to play. Along with the campaign that'll take you around 4-6 hours to complete, you also get a revamped Spec-Ops mode, which now includes a survival mode where you along with another player try to survive against endless waves of enemies weilding weapons (No zombies here if that's what you were hoping for). While it isn't nearly as awesome as Zombies, it is still a blast to play. The Spec Ops missions are also really well done, and are fun to play through multiple times. The level design in the single player, special- ops mode/survival mode, and the multiplayer is exceptional and is a step up from the previous Modern Warfare games. So I've mentioned the positives, now it's time to talk about the negatives. While the graphics engine isn't terrible per se, it looks really bad in some parts of the game. Multiple times I saw texture pop ins and small glitches. Come on guys, we live in a  post- Battlefield 3 era and they are honestly trying to say that this is the best that they could do?! Even the most hardcore Call Of Duty fan cannot deny how goregous Battlefield 3 looks, but here when I look at MW3's graphics it makes me feel like I traveled back in time to the stone age of gaming. It also makes me feel like I'm playing an expansion pack for Modern Warfare 2 instead of a full fledged sequel. The multiplayer (Which is the reason a lot of people play these games) while definately a step up from the unbalanced MW2, still has a number of overpowered weapons and death streaks. Add that in with the number of camping spots and you are sure to have some fustrating matches. It was clear that when around 40 staff left Infinity Ward that Modern Warfare 3 was going to take a hit, and in some areas it does. While it is still worth full price, this entry WILL NOT win over anybody who hates this franchise with a passion. Here's hoping that Black Ops 2 will restore the franchise to it's former glory and change-up the familiar COD formula.",petoria21

You get a arsenal of kickass weaponry to back this up,ou got your typical guns:the shotguns,machineguns, and pistols. However, they also throw in a bunch of sci-fi weaponry to mix it up. The game controls are very responsive, and the combat is a blast to play. Another thing that is done really well here is the horror, I crapped my pants several times during this game.

Now a dark entity has been unleashed and he has to find a way to stop it. As chece' as this sounds, the story is pretty damn good, with fascinating supporting characters like Alan's agent Barry, the FBI agent, and several others. The main character is relateable and likeable as well. There are plenty of twist and turns as well. The best part of Alan Wake however is the gameplay, it is so different than any other game I've other played. Now due to the fact that all of you're enemies are possessed by the dark entity, you have to use light to get rid of the darkness, then use your gun to finish them off.

I like vikings. I like turn-based tactical games. I like deep worlds. I like the art style. All the pieces were right, but they didn't come together into an enjoyable game experience.The story violated most of the basic rules of narrative structure. It jumped back and forth between two groups of characters without any sense of how they were connected. I didn't know which characters I was supposed to identify with or care about. Nobody had a character arc. Nobody was on a hero's journey. One character unavoidably lost an arm, while another died at the end. I didn't care. There's a villain to fight at the end, but we never saw much of him or learned much about him. The plot is full of loose threads and unexplained ****The devs spent a lot of time on the world map, which was full of elaborate history and descriptions. But the map was slow to load, and it had no impact whatsoever on the gameplay. The game runs on rails. The few times you get an illusion of choice on where to go, the map isn't available to help you decide.The Oregon-Trail aspect of the game is a trap for the unwary. You must choose between spending limited points on better stats for your fighters and food for your mass of followers. Metacritic reviewers report that feeding your followers has no impact on the game's outcome. You can apparently let your followers starve and finish the game just fine.This game's main strength is the turn-based tactics system, which is distinctive but not very deep.  The combat is not tied to any underlying reality. It's not simulating anything. For example, you can attack someone's health, which reduces their ability to do damage and brings them closer to death. Or you can attack their armor, which means that subsequent attacks can do more damage to their health. I couldn't imagine how a warrior could swing a sword one way to break armor, then a different way to damage health. I got no immersion from the combat system. It was just a logic puzzle to be solved. And the final battle is stupidly difficult on normal. I didn't bother finishing it.The art is truly beautiful. Kudos to the artist. I didn't mind the many walking scenes that were designed to emphasize the smallness of the characters against the vastness of the wilderness. When the world began to literally fall apart, I felt the loss of beauty. If you don't slow down to enjoy the art, you're missing the best part of the game.",LeonidasRex

Volition, go  yourselves for selling out.Enough with the GTA comparisons. Having played every single GTA and Saints Row game, I can assure you that they aren't even close to competitors.The Saints Row series has really declined over the year, yet everyone hails this game as being a savior simply because GTA IV was too boring. Most of the people who are reviewing this game never played SR1, so they think Saints Row was always this ultra silly, casual alternative to the slightly more serious GTA. In the first game, the whole focus was the 3rd Street Saints. You weren't a Gary Stu, you were just a wild card in the gang. Most of the gameplay revolved around following your Lieutenant's orders. You actually had to use gang members, play the activities, and gain territory. It wasn't simple, nor was it easy. Level 8 Snatch activities, I rest my case. Those were infuriatingly impossible.In the first game, we had more clothing customization. We had more layers of clothes to choose from. We could zip and unzip outfits, turn hats, put up our hoods, lower our pants, and frankly do whatever the hell we wanted. There was more intricate jewelry, a wider variety of clothing stores, and most importantly of all, colors mattered. Nowadays, respect is nothing more than some  equivalent of levels in your average RPG.In SR1, you could rob stores at different times of the day. If you burglarized stores at night, you broke in to the back, cracked the safe, and carried out boxes of goods. You then had to load them into trucks and drive them to a fence.In SR1, you could buy liquor and joints. Not that getting high or drunk was all that important, but it made you feel more like a gangster and it also allowed you to punch people ridiculous distances.In SR1, activities had 8 levels instead of 6. The final 2 levels of practically every activity were absurdly challenging, even on Normal.In SR1, respect and money didn't grow on trees. You couldn't just buy meaningless properties that sit there in a static environment and do nothing. You actually had to play the activities and contribute to the well being of your gang to continue to do missions. In SR3 respect is thrown at me for taking a piss on the sidewalk.In SR1, there was an actual story worth following. Los Carnales, the Rollers, and the Vice Kings put the SR2 and SR3 gangs to shame. Benjamin King alone is a better character than the combined cast of SR3. The narrative isn't limited to LOL SO RANDUMB kind of humor made for 12 year olds who are convinced that GTA is supposed to be some ultra silly casual party game. That's literally where the SR2/SR3 audience came from. They played San Andreas, thought that every GTA game was like that, got mad about GTA IV, then forced their way into the Saints Row userbase.In SR1, there were stronghold missions. Even these were kept in SR2. In SR3, a stronghold is some useless building with nothing to do in it that sits around and makes you more money to spend on absolutely nothing.In SR1, your phone was actually useful. There were phone numbers all throughout the game that made Stilwater feel much more alive and real. It wasn't limited to 911, taxis, and other dumb ****.I could continue to go on about all the features that SR1 had that were stripped away in SR2 and further removed in SR3, but I'll end with this. I 100% completed Saints Row The Third in 17 hours and 40 minutes. If you actually think this game deserves anything more than a 6, you must have the lowest standards on the planet. There is no new content to this game. The more serious tone has been completely abandoned for stupid kiddie humor and bland characters with absolutely no development. The whole community is filled with idiots who want furries and ponies and random  they find online. The quality of game was sacrificed for slightly improved graphics in a boring, static city with no exploration allowed. The worst part is that there is genuinely no content. Once you beat the missions, clear the activities, and get the collectibles, you're done. The activities are so short, I have 100% control of the city before the story even ends.Saints Row 3 is a bastardization of the previous two Saints Row games. The worst part is, this game is a pile of rubbish BEFORE the season pass bull**** I can only hope this was a product of mismanagement at THQ, and that Volition will do better in the future like we know they can. Oh wait, the same problems are happening under new management.",DrZoidberg1000

So why am I not giving 10 stars but only 7? Well, I'd love to give 7.5, but that's not an option on this site. It's almost hitting 8 stars, but definitely not 10. Let's see the positives: 1. Great atmosphere. There is a lot, i mean A LOT to do and whether or not the player is gonna do everything or not, it depends how long can someone fiddle around on an area. Despite some people claiming, that it can be difficult, there are some redundant side missions here, that actually won't really raise nor give any significant loot, especially if you happen to stumble upon a mission, that has 1 or 2 level lower opponents. 2. Great graphics and sound. While the birds eye view camera may not be everyone's cup of tea, the environment is drawn beautifully and the music is top notch, along with special effects and sound effects. 3. Great depth of gameplay. As I mentioned already, there is plenty to do, and nearly infinite combinations of gear and mixture of skills to be learned, as well as party selection and party training. The game can be also very long, depending how far the gamer will go to try and check everything. Ok, so here comes the reasons for 3.5 score: 1. Inventory/loot/equipment management. I can't think of a game, that I spent at least 50-60% of my time fiddling with my gear and equipment. It's now. literally 5 minutes travel -> find a book or a gear -> 15 min. switching gear, switching spells, identifying, selling, buying, dropping, adding, mixing, combining, cooking, experimenting, repairing comparing. It totally pulls the halt on the gameplay.It's just gets annoying and boring.  Just to progress along and get that extra edge from gear and spells and potions to beat a superboss or 1-2 level higher npcs, I have to carefully pick-and choose what gear I'm wearing and what spells I'm knowing and also my 3 other companions.So it's a lot of dress-up-Barbie game going on, and it gets tedious after a while.Also, the game feels like, you do have to reload that fight area at least once, because you got no clue what is about to hit you. There are perma-deaths (  you may turn into a cow, or insta-killed along with your party) with no warnings. You can easily walk into a super boss and get massacred.Fights - Some fight can last an hour! And it isn't just because a lot of enemies to kill, but they are slow and taking their time, and I'm just sitting back and staring at the zombie slowly edging toward my character. So I'll go get a sandwich. Then I forgot, that the game is running, and 2 hours later I sit back to the computer and trying to remember what is going on.Oh yeah, and the mission structure.People like me, who doesn't have a lot of time to play many hours/day will loose track what they are doing or what they are supposed to do.I just simply walk around now, trying to kill NPCs and pick up books and letters and see if I can get out of the area. I have completely lost the thread, all I know some bad guy want to kill me and I supposed to kill some bad guys. That's the main mission in a nutshell.so the game is definitely not 10, but not even 8.  I still recommend it to hardcore RPG players. Others, casual players shall be warned.

Since this supposed to be the ""release"" version (1.0 +) , I expected more things being fixed and the game tuned better, more bugs taken out, and more gamer friendly.Despite I know almost everything how to build rockets and balance it right, a newcomer will struggle. There should be at least ballon help for the parts and easier mechanics for assembly.I understand this is an indie title (and probably the best one out there), but I don't see any real progress from alpha to final. It's like, the developers themselves got bored of it and just kicked it out the door with a price attached to it.As I said, as an alpha indie game, it's fantastic, but I hoped to see more.The interface in the hangar is mediocre.  There is hardly any explanation of what is what and how it comes together.Text doesn't scale, so people with 1080 resolution will either have to stick their heads to the monitor or get glasses. Forget about 4K people, they will need a microscope.Sounds continuosly cuts out periodically, as the loop of the sound effect ends and restarts.I have 32GB of memory and an upper midrange card (960 GTX 2GB) , and yet I still feel like there are performance issues, especially in orbit. And that, considering the fact, that the game isn't really pushing textures and visual quality to begin with.The gameplay could have used more TLC. The missions are fun, but it gets hard from easy really fast.  People should not rely on youtube to know a game. This goes for all games here, not just this. I found this an unacceptable practice, that gone haywire and now developers just cut the whole introduction and tutorials out of the game. I know Kerbal has a tutorial, but it's hardly enough. It's more like just an excuse.So to sum it up, my dislike isn't about whether the game is good or bad, but more about lack of polish and lack of content added to the final version.As an alpha or an early access, it's an exemplary game and goes fully recommended to everyone, but as a final product - considering what it was in alpha- I can't give a thumbs up.I know, I am going against the flow here, and I understand that many will not like my review, but I'm not here to please people, but give my fair share of thoughts and my opinion.",Pannon

If you'd do some research, you would find out that it's part of the money making scheme. Since being an open beta, while taking cash like a fully patched-finished platinum title encourages them to keep the game in a beta-stage and dodge complaints by claiming ""hey, it's a beta""! ""What did you expect?""I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but logically thinking- and just counting how some companies trying to find a way not go under funded and loose money, the logical answer why this game is still in beta stages is: Because it's profitable. If you haven't figured this out yet, maybe you will in a year or 2. You can carve it in stone so you will remember that I said it first.So, Back to this free-to-play game.The pluses I give to credit where credit is due is just the game engine, graphics, and finding the compromise between realism and playability, when it comes to controls. The planes feel real. Medium/heavy bombers feel heavy and cumbersome, fighters feel agile - according to their tech level and design. You'd expect a bi-plane to be highly manouverable, while you'd expect a mid-tier  late '40s fighter to be fast and well armed.  You'll find these in the game and it's done just as well as in many previous Russian-origin simulator titles, such as IL2-Sturmovik or the predecessor of WoT- Wings of Prey.The game can be quite addicting...for a while. The graphics, the sense of speed and satisfaction after a good bombing run or a well placed burst taking down an enemy bogey can make you want more.Unfortunately, my list of positives coming to an abrupt end, since the gameplay will get quite repetative, especially if you think, you can get away without paying for a premium account.Again, I'm not revewing this game as a typical game, which usually go for 40-50 dollars, but the free-to-play ""beta"" game.Let me state this: You won't get too far without a premium account. And if you won't believe me, ask others, who played it forever. Watch youtube videos, read the forums. You CANNOT progress too far without a premium account, unless you are ready for the punishment of grinding for quie a long time and being stuck in the same aircraft, that you ""may"" not like or end up facing superior - upper tier crafts, which will shred you to pieces within the first 30 seconds.For those who have no idea what I'm talking about.1. The game set up, so there are ties- depending on the aircrafts available for axis and allies. Starting with pre-war airplanes with similar capabilities put into categories, you can fly them (regardless of nationality or historical alliances) to do a team-battle against each other  in arcade mode. (the simulator mode and historical modes are different, I'm writing about the arcade type of game, which is by far- the most popular part). After you return from the battlefield, you gain experience by shooting other planes or ground targets or completing game objectives (bomb the airfield, land and take the airfield etc). Once you gained some experienced, you have to ""research"" the next tier aircraft available and then buy it. After buying the next tier aircraft, you may be put into battles with planes with similar capabilities in the next tie.The problem is, that you may have worked on and spent and researched 1 aircraft, while you had 3 or 3 ""free"" tier 1 craft and now you got 4 aircraft , with one being tier 2, while the others are tier 1.And that will force you to either send your tier 2 craft to ""holiday"" - and keep fighting with your tier 1 planes against tier 1 planes and you won't be able to fly your new tier 2 plane.  If you decide to step up, then you gonna have to face the reality, that you got 1 tier 2 plane and 3 or 4 tier 1 planes, which are far inferior to be played on the map- designed to be played by tier 2 planes. And planes go down fast, I mean, you want to stay in the game for at least 10 minutes, then you need at least 3-4 planes available for each battle. If you are stuck with only one capable craft and 3 low-level planes, then you gonna end up struggling until you earn enough credits to replace all 3 - tier 1 planes with something better. If you can think you can play anyway - be my guest- I have done it. I have gone the hard way to earn my tier 2 crafts and it took me forever, not mentioning that many times my gameplay on a battle was no longer than 2-3 minutes, due to my tier 1 craft being a target practice dummy for superior aircrafts on the map.  Just think about it flying against BF109 or Spitfire with a bi-plane from the 30s. If that sounds hilarious, you're right. But this game will force you to do that, because - drumroll- you don't have a Premium Account to buy planes for real $$!",Pannon

The difficulty system is innovative and works wonderfully - you gamble hearts in order to increase the difficulty from 1.0 to  9.0 (in 0.1 increments) - but atI'm not one to readily give out top marks, but if ever there was a game deserving a 10/10, this is it. It is just pure fun. It's fast paced and crazy, and at higher difficulty levels requires complete attention and perfect timing. The difficulty system is innovative and works wonderfully - you gamble hearts in order to increase the difficulty from 1.0 to  9.0 (in 0.1 increments) - but at higher difficulties, the rewards are much greater too.  And as you progress in the game, you will not only accumulate the weapons and powers to tackle the higher intensities, you will be constantly improving too. This is one of those games that you constantly get better at, and when things go well and you dodge those attacks perfectly, it feels wonderful.The amount of content is insane. Apart from a fairly long story mode that should take 10-ish hours to complete, you can obviously replay each chapter at higher intensities to collect better reward, and complete over 100 different challenges. There's a boss mode in 3 difficulties, about 400 idols to collect, an egg-launching minigame, and to top it all off, a REALLY fun multiplayer mode which includes a Free For All and Team-Based game mode. You take in your own weapons and powers, and the game uses a clever system to balance out strong and weak weapons, so you really need to think about whether you want to bring in your strongest weapon into the fray. At the moment, the multiplayer is still well populated, I haven't once had any difficulty finding a match to join.The story is delivered mostly in-game through dialogue happening during the action - it makes things faster and more fluid. The voice acting is brilliant, and the writing hilarious. There are plenty of random conversations that fill occasional silences, and they vary between levels, weapons you have equipped etc. The jokes might not be for everyone (they're a little on the cheesy side, you may groan occasionally) but the entire game is so light-hearted, and especially Pit so infectiously optimistic and cheerful, that it seems impossible to not have a smile on your face while playing this.The soundtrack is also fantastic, with tracks ranging from dramatic orchestral sounds, to funky jazz tunes, even to metal in one level. Many of the pieces could have been taken straight from a Disney movie, and not rarely I find myself humming one or another tune from the game - good thing that all the game's tracks are unlockable to listen to individually.Of course, it would be impossible not to address the elephant in the room, the controls. For some reason, reviewers seem to be incapable of playing this game, yet somehow, everyone I know who actually bought this game and gave it a chance, loved it. If you're not used to DS/3DS controls, it will probably feel awkward for a while. Even if you've owned a DS for many, many years, you may still need some time to get used to them. But that's just it: You will get used to them. When at home (and yes, this game is so good that I tend to sit at my powerhouse of a PC and play on my handheld), I use the convenient stand that is included for free. When I'm out and about, I hold the system in my hands, which while less comfortable, is still perfectly fine, at least for a few hours at a time.So, controls - you can get used to them. The game - fun, fast and furious. The atmosphere - light hearted and funny, even when things get serious. Plus, many, MANY more hours of content than most PC/home console games these days (I recently passed the 100 hours mark). Overall, it is quite simply a 10/10. There certainly aren't many games this good out there.",Ridnarhtim

Literally all you have to do is have someone in your field of view, wait a couple seconds and shoot.Overall its a game I'll play every once in awhile because its just too damn repetitive to play often.

22999,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        **Could contain minor spoilers**I LOVE the game! It has so many things to enjoy. Every NPC has his/her own story to follow. And every time you replay the days you get to follow any story you like. It is a very original game overall and the cutscenes and the way the story is told is brilliant. I also love the deeper meaning this game has with the masks of how we all carry many different masks from time to time but we are still the same person underneath. And how Skull kid carries a mask just because he thought he wasn't accepted the way he was when it turns out that there is nothing wrong with him, the mask was the thing that were wrong. This game is filled with action, drama, philosophy, mysteries, secrets and so much more. And the detail that gives the game an even greater experience is to be able to play the role of the legendary Deku, Goron and the Zora and to be able to use their different skills. Simply amazing.Many complain about that the graphics are old but the game is from year 2000 so that's how the graphics were back then. And if you rate a game mainly on the graphics then you obviously don't know how to rate games. The game is brilliant, no question about it.The only bad thing i can come to think of is the time limit of the days in-game. The time goes to quickly (even with the ""Inverted song of time"") and it's hard to enjoy the game fully out without having to feel stressed and that you need to push through the story of the game. I would have liked it if the time would have gone even slower (still with the possibility to speed up or skip time) so you could enjoy the game more and so you wouldn't have to always feel this urge to hurry up. Because right now you have to jump forth and backwards in time a lot and it can be kind of annoying from time to time. But that is the only thing i can judge as negative.I really hope to see a remake of this game in the future with updated graphics and updated in-game details. Maybe with an expanded range of characters and stories to follow.",Poppeloppiluss

The game is so poorly made in my honest opinion for it's time (not judging the graphics, nothing wrong there). But the programming is horrible. Literally ALL the gangs is shooting you on sight and you can't really free roam the game or complete certain side missions after a certain period of time since you will simply die. I think they messed the game up because of that. And the story missions needs to be completed in a strict order, which is not stated in the game in any point, in order to get 100% completion since some missions become unavailable if you don't complete them in a certain order. The whole game functionality seems extremely unnatural and wasn't even that good from the beginning. In a modern city full of a highly developed species as the human being and no one can swim. come on Rockstar, are your brain-cells functioning? And the functionality of the cars where a car simply catching fire and blow isn't how cars work in real life and the traffic is horrible. They drive into you and when you drive as an ambulance with the sirens on some cars simply just stop in front of you and block you which is highly illegal in real life and most people in GTA shouldn't be programmed to do that. All the drivers in GTA 3 must have gotten their driver license in a cereal box or the programmers was horrible at their job. I understand that somethings were a lot harder to do back then but the function of the content in the game is no hard thing to program with the frames they had to work with. To program a car blowing up like that or to change it to act like a real car in real life and not blow up for just falling over is a simple programming which doesn't require more than what they programmed. If they would have put some thoughts and time to develop the content instead of just focusing on the 3D graphics then this could have been a good game. The game was a big fuss simply because it was the first GTA game in 3D and everyone got kind of blind by that but from the first time i played through this game back in 2003 then i was already disappointed of the content because i got a really cheap feeling. Like buying a fancy box and when you open it, it is empty. That is the kind of impression this game had on me. A lot of things have become better and GTA V was a great game and well made in not just the graphics but also the content and the functionality of how the details work in the game. But this game is a shameful spot in the history of Rockstar in my humble opinion. My recommendations is to lay this game to rest for good. Never put it back into a console, just leave it on the shelf... or a box down in the basement or maybe throw Frisbee with the disc, then it will at least come in good use.",Poppeloppiluss

That's pretty much all that i can think of as positive.This game feels so cheap and just poorly made especially if you have in mind the budget they've had for making this game, they had the chance to make a splendid sequel which in my opinion is something they failed very very bad at. There are so many aspects which are full of flaws. Items and weapons disappear out of nowhere, once you drop a weapon or if a enemy drop a weapon it disappear if you turn your back away, it even happens while it's on screen. There is no depth in the story and it kind of doesn't feel like halo at all. The game is very repetitive and also very short, sometimes it feels like they've used the same maps but just rearranged some things. In Spartan Ops is the same maps but just playing them in reverse.The respawn system in Spartan Ops is also crap, you literally respawn where you die which puts you in a spawn kill loop where you are surrounded with knights that simply kill you once you respawn and i just laughed at how poorly made this game is. You can't hijack banshees which i tried on several missions which also adds up on the negatives.When you buy the game, the only thing that is available is the campaign. Spartan Ops and all other things in Halo 4 requires Gold membership which is **** So technically when you buy the game you only get to play the short campaign and if you wanna play more you have to pay monthly to do so. I looked forward to Halo 4 and looked upon 343 industries as a new chapter who had the possibility to fix all the bad stuff with the previous games like the bad AI for instance, but instead they kept all the bad stuff and added some more just for the fun of it.I feel awkward on behalf of 343 industries who, with all the resources, people and finances to release such a disaster. I have been a fan of halo series and was really hoping for improvement but this is the end of the line for me.

They are poor programmed and doesn't have any tactic to follow, they simply run in battle and get themselves killed and you have to literally babysit them all of the time. They shoot you in the back all of the time and walks in front of your line of fire. They sometimes doesn't respond when you stand beside them with a vehicle they can enter. And one of the biggest nightmares is when they are controlling the turret/gunner positions, they don't hit the enemies and also rarely shoots at all, making you to drive around in circles until you get killed.Sometimes weapons disappear through the floor when you drop a weapon which is very frustrating. The AI characters have gotten me killed so many times that it simply is frustrating to even keep playing. The game is messing things up for the player who maybe easily would have completed a certain mission unless the AI wouldn't have messed it up for you. With such a high budget Bungie has then this is unacceptable.This glitchy details and AI problems is really ruining a otherwise GREAT game! I love the halo series and the story and apart from all these details it is a game i could easily have rated 8-9 but because of all the aspects that are really bad I have to give it a 6 unfortunately.",Poppeloppiluss

It lets you automate the intricacies of being a coach in game so you can focus on playing, or you can take full control yourself.  All this would normally make for a great basketball game, if it weren't for one thing. The controls are horribly sluggish and inconsistent. I have had instances where i had a clear fast break, hit the shoot button 5 feet from the basket, and the player ran past and out of bounds, then tried to shoot. 5 minutes later, i had the same type of fast break, shot 6 feet away and the player stopped on a dime and did a jump shot. When trying to beat a defender, even if you have a clear lane, your player will slow down and some times turn around(!) when you are telling him to charge through. These types of problems would just be annoying, except when the computer gets in the same situations  and worse (heavily defended) the player will just charge through and your players move out of the way. Basketball requires fast reactions, and when it takes a full second for players to respond to your button presses if they don't decide to out right ignore them, it makes the game simply unplayable.One more problem i have pales in comparison to the glaring control issue is what i will call turbo mode, this is where your players will actually move at more than a leisurely walk and will generally put more umf! into their actions. It lasts way to short for what it does. Any basketball player that couldn't go at more than a light jog for 5 seconds would quickly be out of work, but that is the standard in 2k11.I haven't played a basketball game with a controller since live 1995 (i tried the wii, but had issues with the remote registering the wrong commands) so maybe this is just how NBA games are now, but i sure don't like it.",batosai33

Sure it's good compared to Mass Effect 3, but let's forget that disaster for a moment and get down to what Mass Effect 2 had, and what it shouldn't have had.FirstAs a person who's played Mass Effect 2 both on the PS3 and PC, I have all rights to say that with me being a dedicated fan to the franchise, this never stood up to be the proper sequel to Mass Effect 1 everyone wanted to be. Sure it's good compared to Mass Effect 3, but let's forget that disaster for a moment and get down to what Mass Effect 2 had, and what it shouldn't have had.First of all, the PC Port is pretty bad. I mean I am glad that aiming with the mouse works as it should, but binding Sprint/Interact/Cover all to the same button? What happened to the special treatment Mass Effect 1 got for PC? None of that is there, and the game really suffers greatly from having sprint and cover on the same button as you find yourself locking into cover while trying to retreat from the enemies, leaving you completely exposed to their gunfire while you go through the animations of getting out of cover again. Mass Effect 1 had you just pressing against cover without the need of button presses, and allowed you to crouch in cover too. What happened to all of that?Now the removal of overheat and grenades are for balance, I can understand that and honestly I wasn't bothered by it as much as I could've been, however, the in-world explanation is just so damn stupid I can't imagine how BioWare managed to laugh up the fact that it would be a good idea to choose that over the overheat system.A lot of missions are repetitive, which is something all three entries suffer greatly from. While Mass Effect 2 at least varies its' environments, half of the loyalty missions and sidequests consist of nothing but mindless shooting with 2 minute long cutscenes at the start and end trying to justify why it made sense to enter a gunfight, and sadly here Mass Effect 2 doesn't fare any better than any other third person shooter. If you were dumb enough to play as Soldier, you're gonna get the bore of your life as this game is all about biotics and tech, so there are some classes which are absolutely boring to play as compared to others. My personal favorite was Vanguard, which I think was amazing to play as and I had a good time playing through the game.Dialogue wise, it was outstanding, the story is well told and executed surprisingly well looking at the state of gaming back then. The interrupts were a great addition and you can't criticize Mass Effect 2 for its lack of dialogue. This game executes its characters really well and does an excellent job immersing you in the story and making your personal morale affect what choices you make in the game. Top notch!Last but not least, the save game system, which was meh at best. You'd get some letters from people or extra dialogue, however you don't miss a lot not having a Mass Effect 1 save game ready.Overall though, this game is really flawed in comparison to Mass Effect 1. A 4 is the brutally honest rating I'd give this game, because as far as it fares against its predecessor, it's cons largely obscure its pros, merely for the fact that Mass Effect 1 offered almost all of that too.",Doctective

The problem is that Cross is a very long game, and has only few different places, that means you will backtrack in the biggest part of the game. The game uses elements instead of magic and items, and you will every time stop the game to enter in the menu to rearrange the position of the elements in their grids, in order to have a strong party. The game features 54 characters that you can't get in a single play, making you play other times to get all of them. While that brings diversity, most of the characters are useless, don't have a decent development and have similar weaknesses and strenghts of lots of other characters in your gang. The story is pretty, but very confusing, throwing at you thousands of informations in long text parts. In the other hand, the graphics have beautiful colors and the soundtrack is beyond masterpiece, even better than the soundtrack of Chrono Trigger.",JurgenRamnball

167801,Gone Home,PC,10,"Gone Home is a great game.  Full stop. Yes, it is a game. It's not a shooter, it's not an action game, it's not a survival horror game. But it IS a game. Saying it's not a game is like saying that a movie isn't a movie because it doesn't have explosions or car chases.  It may not be your kind of game, or a game you are comfortable with... but it IS a game. And it does the things it isGone Home is a great game.  Full stop. Yes, it is a game. It's not a shooter, it's not an action game, it's not a survival horror game. But it IS a game. Saying it's not a game is like saying that a movie isn't a movie because it doesn't have explosions or car chases.  It may not be your kind of game, or a game you are comfortable with... but it IS a game. And it does the things it is trying to do with grace and assurance.I am amazed at how negative the player response to the game has been... I think there are three reasons.1. The price. The game is going for $20 and it's a short game... between 90 minutes and 3 hours. That makes it shorter than most movies and for the first time we are being asked to pay more per hour for a game than a movie! Oh man the gall! How dare they! ...well they do dare and I think in this case it's on purpose. It's an ok thing to make an indie game that is revolutionary and then give it away because 'you know it's not a 'real' game... but to make a indie game that refuses to meet player expectations, to do it well with polish style and impact... and then to DEMAND that players acknowledge it's worth by asking them to pay a premium for it... it seems that that is not ok with a lot of players. I guess it's fair to want a longer game for your money. For me, well I say rock on, I got what I paid for.2. Presentation. The game presents like it's going to be a survival horror game. It plays with that expectation. Even new video game players feel it and say things like 'This is creepy, I think something is going to jump out at me!'  The game wants you to feel that, but the game is not 'about' that, it's about atmosphere not monsters. Getting upset at that is like getting mad because your psychological drama didn't turn out to be a horror movie. I guess being upset at this is fair enough, if you don't like the games actual genera then I can see feeling tricked by it's atmosphere. That does not make it a bad game, it just means you don't like that kind of game.3. Subject matter. I won't spoil but a lot of the user reviews have a layer or discomfort or fear surrounding the subject matter of the game. I love it, and I love that it has gotten under these gamer's skins even if they would deny that. The gentle honest subtle presentation of the subject matter is the first time it has been addressed that way in games, and really one or the few times we see it addressed that way in media at all.  You may not like the story, fair enough. Perhaps you should ask yourself why you don't like it. Despite what you may be telling yourself it's not because it's shallow, poorly told, or because (and one reviewing player actually said this) because 'the textures are bad'.In any case I hope you take the time to decide for yourself. I think in 20 years people will be looking back at this game as one of if not the moment games grew up.",Ryha2000

It's hard but incredibly satisfying.Visually it's a stunning game with an excellent attention to detail that makes me feel I'm really ""there."" Sound is top notch too. Oh, and it's a great pick-up-and-play sort of game. Only have 30 mins? Play a couple quick stages, or hop into the daily challenges and do your best!Good luck.",dingdong

It is without a shadow of a doubt the best rally game in existence - by far the best in the series. This is what fans have been waiting for - a DIRT that is nothing but pure rally, what we wanted all along. It's a stunning looking game, a great variety in environments to race on, and an enormous number of vehicles each of which feel and sound how they are supposed to. Every time you race a stage it feels totally different as you can race them at any time of day and with any weather conditions. Between the multiplayer, rally cross, hill climb and of course the rally stages there is a wealth of content. It is a also highly addictive, and no other game has brought me back time after time in order to see myself further up the charts. It's a hugely challenging game and the Masters level rally competitions are extremely difficult to win - but still a hell of a lot of fun also. Pure rally is a far more exciting form of racing than other genres, because the risk of crashing out and having to exit a rally can happen with a single twitch in movement going wrong. The rally cross multiplayer is also a great element in the mix, and again lots of fun.

He ended up showing me the Paris trailer and it sold me. After that the beta came out and I enjoyed it despite the buggy state that was to be expected of a beta game. After buying it I am absolutely in love with this game and satisfied.   The single player game is like most fps games. Short (5 hours or so) and almost forgettable. I'm not saying it's bad because it's not. The story was decent, the visuals were good, the combat got a little predictable after awhile but still fun. I did enjoy it but give it a few months and I won't really remember the story.   The co-op was a good idea. I would really only play this with a friend but I wasn't as fortunate. If I'm a not getting paired up with a moron who stands in the wide open getting gunned down only for me to save him it's a very solid addition. All of the co-op missions are unique. Some are just out right run and gun. Some are about protecting vehicles. One of them you and your teammate are in a helicopter and have to protect a squad of infantry and in another you and your teammate are snipers moving from point to point to cover a squad. You also earn points that go towards unlocking guns for multiplayer and dog tags so their is a reward to playing it too.   The multiplayer is where this game shines as one would expect for an fps. It's a faster paced fps so their will always be action around every corner. Quite a few different game types for everyone to enjoy. You progress through ranks, rank up the class you play, unlock guns through your rank and class, and also unlock around 19 different upgrades for every guns that help out in various situations.  The destructible element of the game makes things interesting. Are enemies camping inside a building and mowing down your teammates? Get in a tank or switch to an engineer and blast the wall out so they are in the wide open. One thing that usually makes or breaks the multiplayer for me are the maps. Dice took a lot of time on these maps. Most of them are well done to the point that I don't have a preference as to which one I'm playing anymore. The levels have several close quarter areas which i personally enjoy and some longer range engagements that are good for snipers or vehicles.   Visually that game is great. Dice pushed forward forcing the next gen of PC hardware to come out. The large maps are gorgeous. The lighting effect are the best I've seen so far in a game. The texture mesh on the uniforms of the soldier's is very realistic if you scope in on it. The smoke and fire in the game is very really. Couldn't have ask for a game that was easier on the eyes than this one.  As much as I like this game I have a couple of complaints. This game on the PC version requires about 9 other programs to run it. You need origin, punkbustera, punkbusterb, a web browser open, sonar, BF3 and maybe a few others. It's a memory whore. You can't have any communication in co-op unless playing with a friend. That includes typing. You also can't talk on a multiplayer server, not even in a squad. I also am not a fan of launching it from a browser. I like the traditional way of firing a game up and going to a server list. That way I can just alt tab and come back to this game. The battlelog page was very buggy but it was mostly fixed. Missing dogtags and various stats. Also something to be aware of a lot of people are experiencing random crashes quite often even with high end hardware so beware. I personally don't have this problem. I've also seen that the customer support sucks, some of the support people end internet chat sessions or tell the customer to contact amazon.com when they clearly could easily fix the problem. I will give dice credit they are working hard on bugs and I am seeing improvements quickly. They are also listening to customer feedback on a 3rd party website and actively participating in answer question inside the community and working to implement new things or fix problems.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes faster paced fps to anyone. They have so many different game types to cater to everyone. I myself like the more basic team deathmatch because I'm an old school counter-strike player and not that big into vehicles. I recommend this to cod players (even the bitter ones). I don't know why everyone out their thinks they have to play one or the other or pick a favorite. Bf3 is a solid game and is pushing forward the limits of gaming. I wasn't expecting much from this game as I'm not the biggest fan of EA but I am a very satisfied customer. $50 bucks well spent.",Pyro88

I was kind of skeptical at first about buying this game as there weren't any review on release date but It was worth more than the $10 dollars.

You can agree to announce your friendship then they will turn around and **** on you. The enemy A.I. will endlessly harass you with you crap deals, declare war on you and call you the warmonger, denounce you out of nowhere when you've supplied them with resources and gold for many turns and not to mention the barbarians in this game are incredibly annoying; coming into your territory only a few turns into the game with multiple units and taking your workers then leaving. The happiness system is trash and the game punishes you for expanding and conquering. All options with conquered cities give large amounts of unhappiness and only decrease if you waste points on policies or have a large amount of luxuries that counter the unhappiness. Also, the tech tree has been severely trimmed... turning many technologies into one thing instead of taking multiple trees to complete it.Other than the unique traits and few unique units nothing really sets the civilizations apart from eachother. Multiplayer is extremely laggy and even a 100 or so turns into a quick game it takes several seconds sometimes minutes to go to the next turn... Marathon is a nightmare. What really disappoints me about this game is the fact that the computer will declare war on you or something of that nature and then try to make peace... asking for everything you have and if you decline they keep harassing you even though it's extremely easy to defend against them so it becomes just a hassle.Overall it's just a huge disappointment. Too many features cut and too many things dumbed down to appease the idiots and lazy people who don't want to take the time to learn and play the game correctly. If it's not spoon fed to them they complain and it totally shows in the way Firaxis designed this game. Total piece of crap to be honest.",Rumpelstiltskin
99685,Guild Wars 2,PC,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Pros:Beautiful sceneryDetailed character modelsIntuitive and addicting crafting systemSmooth combat once adjusted to integrating dodging/weapon swapping into your combosCons:Skill selection is highly limited to certain dedicated slotsOverflow (hopefully temporary) is highly irritating, especially when trying to coop with friendsThere can be some level gaps when advancing through the story that force you to grind out a level or twoClunky inventory/banking systemHigh repair and fast travel costs (compared to the rate at which money is earned)First off, this isn't a bad game; not by a long shot. When Guild Wars 2 was first announced, I was ecstatic. I was looking forward to even deeper build customization and even deeper PvP. The original Guild Wars did so well what many MMO's failed to do on a massive level; and that was create a balanced and completely skill based PvP community. However, on being introduced to the beta and playing for a few days now on the headstart I realized the build customization and PvP took a small step back.Gone are the days of tinkering with 1,000's of different skill combinations, putting any skill in any slot. No matter if it was a boon, a shout, an adrenaline attack, spell, etc. Now you have dedicated skill slots with considerably fewer choices. You are given a weapon with a minimal amount of skills to use, in fact you don't even get to pick the skills for whatever weapon you are using; they are predetermined and unlocked within five minutes of killing a few devourers. This can be problematic to players looking to say, build a straight up tank when many of the skills and abilities you can choose from wouldn't benefit your desired build. Slot skills, or utility skills, are the biggest selection but for many classes, a good majority of them are either no used to do to just being useless or, just aren't powerful enough to say, take the spot of something that would just give a large damage increase.Secondly, the PvP has been largely turned into a massive zerg fest; and it has been directly affected by the changes to the skill slotting system I mentioned. Now that you are forced to only take a certain amount of each type of skill it cuts down the amount of possibilities considerably, and also lowers the usefulness of some classes to a degree; if a class cannot, say, choose to grab a bunch of cc or something like that they might be passed up entirely in favor of someone who provides raw damage; instead of 50% damage and 50% soft cc.Third and last, and definitely least, the map/ui needs a lot of work. It is hard to tell where one zone ends and another begins. Which can become problematic when trying to clear out a zone or search vistas, points of interest or anything else regarding map exploration. While the absence of traditional quests is a fresh change of pace but it also presents a very big problem. Many world events take way too much time to not be considered a waste of time. especially when you could walk twenty feet in the other direction and complete a heart assist; not too mention you're not even guaranteed to get a gold contribution level or decent loot on completely what can sometimes be a 30-45 min world event. For example in Diessa Plateau, you help some townsfolk fend off a giant who is attacking their town. I spent 30 min helping roughly 20 people kill this sucker; guess what? I got a bronze contribution level even though I'd be willing to bet I did probably 10% of the damage and revived people over 50 times.All in all, for an MMO of this size to be running so smoothly (compared to other launches), I am highly impressed. NCSoft has released a game that is subscription fee free, but has the content of other premium MMOs, and then some. What usually breaks a game at launch (massive server load without proper planning) has been alleviated somewhat buy the overflow system. It can be highly annoying but at least it has made the game playable and enjoyable. Hopefully it's only temporary as this game has massive potential with everything that has been implemented. Long story short, NCSoft has crafted a fantastic game that might not succeed in being better than it's predecessor, but, it succeeds in being a rich and engaging MMO with rich combat and a great story.",Rumpelstiltskin

45869,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Wii,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I am a big fan of these games and now this game has been up the next level by making the Wii go on line and challenge your friends or just random people.They is a least new characters on this game some take time to know what skills they do.On the downfall I hate this game for:On line can be slow to connect if you playing with random players in a team got to wait at least 20 minus or so before another guy comes on and then it sometimes disconnect you off then you have to start again finding players.And you trip a lot too on this game half a time I lost in the sudden death mode because I tripped up and a bomb landed on my head and I could not move in time to avoid it or the other player killed me.The game is detail in the characters that is on it.The levels is awesome and some playable enough.The songs/music is well composed and nice to listen to.They 's is the challenges you can do for more stuff in the game that will take you a few days to do.The game is just great, it's fast paced with extra bits like a stage builder you can now re-create the old levels in other games but it has hardly room to make a lot of things to make it annoying for you.Overall I personally love this game too bits.",leeemmott

80424,Halo: Reach,Xbox360,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This is just so good the series now has some new power ups to use in the game they 's:jet pack, sprint, a decoy to use which works pretty well vs other people it stand somewhere and won't do a thing but then you can lob a grenade if they close to it,the camouflage basic ly turns you in visible until you run so moving slow is the best way to use this little gadget, drop shield gives you a shield to reflect bullets, armour lock the guy will fall on his knees and punch the floor so the guy who use it will be immortal for the time being but the biggest drawback is that you're open to attack after you done it.Well single player is always the same apart from when you have to fly this ship and shoot down other ships, single player can be a bit dull and boring at times.My biggest fave of all time for Halo Reach is the big multiplayer option and so many game modes on it up to 8 players with 2 360 's they can join in.My fave mode is infection or zombie mode where one person is this zombie with high life and a good weapon and must infect others by killing them.Can sound easy but it's not.That's not all, they is the on line mode too with other players.So any Halo fan would love this 10/10",leeemmott

You have less space to carry things. (9 items for each character)2. You're friend or partner is un sure of what to do when they are surrounded by the bad guys they pick up ammo, health power ups for you yes but they don't attack the bad guys when surrounded not often enough.Mostly the CPU.3. You can't pause game at all game is ruined by this cause people can attack you still.4. You can't run and shoot like RE6 boo.What I like about this game is I recently got it and liked the new weapons on itlike the 1 handed shotgun which only Chris can hand it 1 hand.The mercenaries has more stages on it too which will take hours and hours getting SS ranks.This game should please Resident Evil fans as it's as close as RE4 can be.",leeemmott

I was hoping this would be like the N64 version, sadly it's not no way.Ok story now changed totally the first few level 's is ok but after you go to these other places that was NEVER in Golden eye in the first place so why put them in this game if they mean nothing to the game?And oh yes you get Dan Craig in this time not Bros man that I did not like they should stick with the old people the first people who was in this game.Also a new villain but I rather have back Sean Bean as him he was better.The on line part can be annoying if the host leaves you leave to due to lag and then you lose the points you gained then back for more games. On line can lag a bit for this game, then the levels has made a lot I never heard before in the other Golden eye game for the mu lit-player mode.As the health it regains instead of picking up armour like the old days this time it's like a COD wannabe to get the fans more money from them by selling short with this game and completely destroy most of it and trying to make it good to sell.It looks so sloppy and new levels that's it that you never heard before.Note, where is a guy who shoots at the screen? Har har he don't the other version did and no Golden eye music like the N64 one just a bad dull one they should copy and paste the music from N64 one then onto there so easy, instead having a new soundtrack to the game that sounds nothing like a James Bond theme at all.Weapons are almost gone too I only find a few looks like they ditched the other good guns on the other one too.In short this is a COD game now let's move on now.",leeemmott

As soon as you put in the game you get one of the cooest cinematics in sports games history. After awe-ing at the cinematic and admittingly losing by over 30 points in the first game. I decided to pick my Lakers and fool around a bit in scrimmage mode, which reveals the only downfall of this game. The difficulty. I was really good at Live and could beat everyone online or at least lose by a point or 2. But 2K11 is incredibly difficult when playing the first few games. By now I have practiced and played long enough (Took me about a week) to win most of the games I play offline. Now that I have talked about the difficulty, let's talk about the gameplay. The entire atmosphere of the game when you start is just phenomenal, while it does get repetitve after a few games or so. At first glance, the graphics seemed so-so, until I went into the replay mode so check out a D-Wade dunk and saw the jaw-dropping graphics that the game had hidden from me at first. The offensive plays you can run seem endless, and if executed correctly, will lead to some amazing finishes. The commentators are awesome, while they too can get repetitive if you play enough games. All in all, this game sets the bar for sports games. And if EA can take a page out of 2k's book, then Live can have a triumphant return. But for now, I can't see myself going back to Live anytime soon. Besides the difficulty which can be brutal to beginners, this game is perfection. 94/100",Tmacfan51

It was the only real moment me and my companion shared and we'd been together since the start of the game. Marching onward close to death until we fell into the snow unable to continue. It was raw, it was powerful, no thought is as colloasal as that of failure.However in the game industry there is a misconception that for a game to be good it must have a happy ending and suddenly the raw emotion and loss I felt from me and my companion dying evaporated as we were miraculously revived and finished out journey.

They have created an intricate ecosystem with competing monsters and countless ants crawling everywhere. I was expecting a bland, open mapFirst of all, I have been playing Monster Hunter since Tri came out. I have followed the series throughout the years and the series has only gotten better. Compared to the previous games MH World has completely revolutionized the Monster Hunter series. They have created an intricate ecosystem with competing monsters and countless ants crawling everywhere. I was expecting a bland, open map full of pretty bushes and some birds flying above. However, i was proved wrong, there are so many things! And you can abduct them and throw them in your home as well! The massive, polished map this game provides completely blew me away.Throughout the series, combat has gotten more fluid (especially in MH Generations) but it always remained a little clunky. The combat in this game has greatly improved (Ignoring the fact that the controls are complete ass and you can't change them). Once you get used to the controls, the combat seems a lot more smooth, making it satisfying to land devastating combos on a massive wyvern yearning for your blood. The Great Sword, which used to feel kinda clunky is a lot more fluid, with multiple combos that flow well into each other, making you feel bad ass after landing a fully charged combo on a monsters tail. The bow has changed as well. Although undermined by the newly added slinger, the bow still proves to be a fun weapon (noticed they made it more mobile and powerful). However, the guns are so boring, there is nothing special about them. They feel clunky, slow and underpowered. Especially the heavy bow gun, been like this since the beginning. But this is just an opinion, you might take a liking to the bow gun.For all you Monster Hunter fans out there, this is a must buy. However, for players that search for an immersive story that provides many hours of entertainment, you will be somewhat disappointed. The game's story is like an ocean that's one foot deep. When you open the game, you are kinda thrown into the story with barely any context and you chase some big dragon (won't reveal more than that). If story is what you are looking for, turn away. This game is mainly based on hunting monsters, not the story behind them.Some players are saying that the combat is sluggish, weapons feel clunky, and it's for little kids??? For new players, combat will definitely feel a little sluggish as you mindlessly spam two buttons for the first few hours. But you will soon discover that the combat is extremely complicated, providing a huge learning curve. There are many combos that flow into each other with ease if done correctly. If combos are done incorrectly you get punished, leaving you completely open to monsters. Some players don't like this because they like to swing a greatsword around at the speed of sound with no consequences. Once you get the hang of these combos you will feel like a bad ass monster hunter. For some reason, I have been noticing reviews stating that the game is for little kids. I must admit, the game does have some weird Japanese **** that appeals to its main fan base. But as soon as you have a monster eat you out like an Oreo you realize that this game ain't cute at all. This is real **** and you're gonna piss your pants when you fight the final boss, trust me.So far, I have been very impressed with the game. However, I have noticed, if you pay some attention, on the Xbox One, the game is kinda blurry (thought I was going blind for a second). Not to much of an issue, only makes me more hyped for the PC version. You probably won't notice unless you look really hard as well. I still can't get over how bad the controls are. Hopefully, they do something about that.The biggest thing about this game is that they decided not to ruin the game with pay-to-win content, loot boxes and cosmetic bull****. Gotta respect that decision. A company that actually listens to its players.TL;DRProsThis game has massive, well-polished worlds.Complicated yet fluid combat.Scary Monsters.NO LOOT CRATES!!!ConsControls are **** and you can't change them.Kinda blurry if you pay enough attention.A shallow story.Game would be a 10, but the controls really killed it for me.",loldeeznutz

However, the guns are so boring, there is nothing special about them. They feel clunky, slow and under powered. Especially the heavy bow gun, been like this since the beginning. But this is just an opinion, you might take a liking to the bow gun.For all you Monster Hunter fans out there, this is a must buy. However, for players that search for an immersive story that provides many hours of entertainment, you will be somewhat disappointed. The game's story is like an ocean that's one foot deep. When you open the game, you are kinda thrown into the story with barely any context and you chase some big dragon (won't reveal more than that). If story is what you are looking for, turn away. This game is mainly based on hunting monsters, not the story behind them.Some players are saying that the combat is sluggish, weapons feel clunky, and it's for little kids??? For new players combat will definitely feel a little sluggish as you mindlessly spam two buttons for the first few hours. But you will soon discover that the combat is extremely complicated, providing a huge learning curve. Once you get the hang of these combos you will feel like a bad ass monster hunter. For some reason, I have been noticing reviews stating that the game is for little kids. I must admit, the game does have some weird Japanese **** that appeals to it's main fan base. But as soon as you have a monster eat you out like an Oreo you realize that this game ain't cute at all. This is real **** and your'e gonna piss your pants when you fight the final boss, trust me.So far, I have been very impressed with the game. However, I have noticed, if you pay some attention, on the Xbox One the game is kinda blurry (thought I was going blind for a second). Not to much of an issue, only makes me more hyped for the PC version. You probably won't notice unless you look really hard as well. I still can't get over how bad the controls are. Hopefully they do something about that.Biggest thing about this game is that they decided not to ruin the game with pay-to win content, loot boxes and cosmetic bull****. Gotta respect that decision. A company that actually listens to it's players.TL;DRProsThis game has massive, well-polished worlds.Complicated yet fluid combat.Scary monsters.NO LOOT CRATES!!!ConsControls are **** and you can't change them.Kinda blurry if you pay enough attention.A shallow story.Game would be a 10, but the controls really killed it for me.",loldeeznutz

As for controls, I don't really play any game with controller so I used a keyboard and mouse here. Surprisingly, this controlled much better than SO many people said it would. I don't have any problems with the controls as they're decent enough. I've just entered Blighttown and haven't had problems with the controls, besides a few odd deaths due to the finicky lock-on mechanic (yeah, this could've been better!).

The original was a stellar game in its day, blending in RPG elements and a detailed story with a FPS gameplay in a way I had never quite seen before. From punching in codes for locked doors to sneaky takedowns, I enjoyed the original Deus Ex immensely.I had skipped Invisible War entirely however due to reports of it being geared toward the consoles way too much. I'll quite likely go back and play it some day, but a Deus Ex themed FPS just isn't what I was looking for at the time. So when the reviews of Deus Ex: Human Revolution being more like the original started to surface, my interest was piqued. I had expected little of Human Revolution before it was released, and I'm quite happy to have been proven wrong in my assumptions.My main complaint with Human Revolution however is that unlike the original Deus Ex, I didn't feel free to play the game as I wished. While yes, you can technically run and gun your way through the whole thing, the EXP system is very heavily geared toward stealth tackdowns and hacking, making the system very all or nothing. If you're at all concerned about missing things, as I am, you'll find yourself playing the way the devs obviously intend rather than how you might like to approach a situation.Much to my surprise however, I maxed out pretty much every half-decent augmentation between 1/2 and 3/4th of the way through the game. At this point EXP became completely moot, so my motivation for being a stealth hacker suddenly fell through the floor. I guess I did too many sidequests and hack-grinding? I must admit though, it actually worked out well enough. I was finally able to play the ""stealth shooter"" I wanted to play, rather than the ""silent assassin"" I had exclusively played up until that point in the game to maximize EXP.At a whopping 35 hours long for my main play-through, plus more for The Missing Link, HR certainly shows its RPG leanings. You're not going to find many FPS titles even approaching that length, though in fairness you're going to spend a fair amount of that running around hub cities, talking to NPCs. With a fairly good story, decent graphics, and fun gameplay - it's easy to recommend to Human Revolutions to other Deus Ex fans out there.",Rirath
164950,PixelJunk Shooter,PlayStation3,8,"PixelJunk Shooter is the first PixelJunk game I've ever really played. I've played the demos of Eden, Monsters, and Shooter all previously, and I've even bought all of them since then (plus Racers 2nd Lap and Eden on PC), but with backlogs what they are these days Shooter is the first one I've actually gotten around to playing. I say that to really say while I'm interested in the PixelJunkPixelJunk Shooter is the first PixelJunk game I've ever really played. I've played the demos of Eden, Monsters, and Shooter all previously, and I've even bought all of them since then (plus Racers 2nd Lap and Eden on PC), but with backlogs what they are these days Shooter is the first one I've actually gotten around to playing. I say that to really say while I'm interested in the PixelJunk series, I didn't go into this as a pre-existing fan.The strongest points of Shooter are its clean, almost vector-like graphics, its bass-heavy soundtrack, and its unique fluid mechanics. Any one of these aspects could warrant a purchase to the right person, but the three in unison produce quite the artistic tour de force. Practically in trade-off for this however is a short gameplay length (Braid, Limbo), a fairly easy difficulty (Fez), and when you get down to it, generally unimaginative gameplay mechanics (Fez, again).Is it fun? Yeeesss... for a time. But few surprises are thrown your way and it's over right when it's gotten warmed up. The core gameplay is, if you look past the unique fluid mechanics, fairly simple. Fly around, collect survivors, kill a few token baddies. It's hardly taxing and fairly evident where the majority of planning and development went to. Two players can help to liven things up a bit, but is generally quite unnecessary.At a little over 4 hours in length its perfectly reasonable for a game of its type, though not a strong point. I'll mention that there's a ""collect all the hidden gems mechanic"" to extend the gameplay by a little bit, but not being much of a completionist, it really did nothing for me and honestly seemed rather tedious. But all in all Shooter is one of those games where the art, the sound, and the mechanics come together well for an experience greater than the sum of its parts.",Rirath

I'm keeping this one, but it wasn't as good as Warlords.",M.Alex

The time and work that went into this game is tremendous, and it should definitely be on every ""Best Of..."" list that you find.

No other developer has sucked this much juice out of the 360 to date--if this is what Epic can do after two years or so of work, what are they going to do after three or four?  The cover mechanic is not only well designed, but it works great for those who take the time to strategically plan stuff out.  Thankfully, being a huge Metal Gear Solid fan, I'm one of those types.  Basically, if you play this game like you play Halo 2, it will murder you.  The run mechanic is also solid--I'm loving the camera while you run--a shaky, cameraman-is-running-with-you floor shot.  It's not much, but it does so much for the game in the way of pacing and building tension.However, it's not totally flawless.  The game falls victim to one of my biggest pet peeves about video games today--the plot of the single player campaign just isn't explained at all.  Stuff happens in the game that leaves you saying things like, ""Who's that?"" ""Why did that happen?"" ""Where are we going?"" and so on.  It couldn't be that hard to insert a title crawl (Star Wars style) to fill people in on the backstory, could it?  Also, I'd like to see more online modes and content in the future.  But the fact is that Gears does everything else so well that it charms you.  It's so easy to get sucked in that you're willing to overlook that stuff and just hope that they fix it for Gears 2.  With solid gameplay, you can take over the world, and Gears proves that ten times over.

The gameplay feels just right, but there is very little depth in it and most of the time its just button mashing. The spell system is alright, however it's overshadowed by you melee weapon. Once your spells reach its maximum level of potency, they become VERY powerful, however, it takes to long to charge, therefore you are better of using your melee weapon. Another problem with spells is that there are no supportive spells (like Heal, Protective shield thing, ect.) like there were in Fable 1, therefore, investing all your points in just Will Power is just a waste of time unless you plan on getting swords stuck up your ass while you're waiting for your spells to charge. Guns are also nice, but again they are overshadowed by your melee weapon once enemies get in close range. Another problem with guns is that most of the time you don't know where enemies are, thus making sniping via the zoom function useless. I find the lack of minimap very frustrating. I truly hate the little glowing thing which you follow, It shouldn't of replace the minimap. Let me explain why: when your following the glowing trail, you follow the glowing trail, and most of the time you don't pay attention to anything else but the glowing trail because you generally don't have an idea of where you are going due to the fact that unfamiliar with the surrounding area. With the minimap, it tells you in the ""general"" direction where to go, so you can start going in that direction and not stare at the ground constantly. There are very few things to buy, and there are few armor sets which are all very poor looking. The UI is atrocious; slow, unresponsive and glitchy. I haven't try the coop yet TBH so I won't talk about it. The storyline is WEAK. Particularly the ending; probably the must disappointing ending in any game i've ever play.

What makes is lousy is incredibly repetitve goals, bland level design, monotonous levels, and stupid AI. *** Were they trying to be ""retro"" with all the steps backward? Because all it really seemed like I was playing the run-and-gun Doom 2 with photorealistic graphics and a heavier atmosphere. Oh well, it does get extra points for genuinely being scary and a not a bad game.",JohnS.
137261,Counter-Strike: Source,PC,9," The graphics are still stunning, and the realism is almost scarry. which is cool. The only thing worth complaining about is the lack of new good levels. Of course, what do you expect from a grass-roots game? levels come from players, not manufacturers.",JohnS.

146243,Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge,Xbox,9," I was all set to hate this game. But after one level, I returned my rental copy and bought it. How's that for a good review? The controls are smooth and intuitive, the music/sound is excellent, and the graphics have that punch and inventiveness that makes you happy you have the best console on the market.

You've never played Capture The Flag until you've played it in all directions like this. My only disappointments are that the system link is only 2 per xbox, and that I want many more game options (defend a zeppelin, bombing runs, etc.) If they add those additions as a download, this could easily replace Halo for those system link game nights I have with friends.",JohnS.
153500,Battlefield: Bad Company 2,PC,0," You know that feeling, when you spent 50 bucks on a piece of shit? I hate that feeling, so if you hate it too, please avoid this game at all costs.

155369,Half-Life 2: Episode One,PC,5," As said elsewhere the game is SHORT, far too short for the money. Gameplay is same old, same old, with nothing new or innovative at all.

The campaign is long and challenging, which is good, excluding the Scrin campaign which was only 4 missions. While playing through the campaign you are presented with HD cinematics (before, after and during missions) which are fairly cheesy and unconvincing, however, it's better then nothing.

Balance wise, the game seems to be almost balance in patch 1.09, except for a few units, so if you're playing still with pre-1.09, I highly suggest you download the patch because it changes several major gameplay mechanics such as the economy which cutsdown ""spamming"" by a lot. Bottom line, if you have ever liked any C&C game, or you like RTS games in general, then I highly suggest you buy this because your missing out on a good game.",JohnS.

The only cons could be easily solved with Xbox Live downloads -- give us vehicles, maybe some low-tech weapons to make things interesting, and keep those game variations coming (""King of the Hill"" would be great).

246092,Neverwinter Nights 2,PC,2," Well, it has the right name, but the game just sucks. here's a 101 reasons why, and I agree with ALL of them: 1: Cant ""Duel Wield"" from a Quick Slot, or even use a Sword and Shield from a Quick Slot. 2: Very Limited Voice Commands and no real easy access to the Sound sets. Why was pressing ""V"" so bad that it had to be taken away? 3: Context Sensitive Menu is Limited in comparison to Well, it has the right name, but the game just sucks. here's a 101 reasons why, and I agree with ALL of them: 1: Cant ""Duel Wield"" from a Quick Slot, or even use a Sword and Shield from a Quick Slot. 2: Very Limited Voice Commands and no real easy access to the Sound sets. Why was pressing ""V"" so bad that it had to be taken away? 3: Context Sensitive Menu is Limited in comparison to the Radial menu. While the Context Sensitive menu is quicker in some situations, the fact that the Radial menu allowed you access to everything at all times means it got more much more use. 4: Very Poor Area Design, it seems that both interior and exterior world spaces suffer from rudimentary design flaws, such as cluttering up combat heavy spaces with placeables forcing your character to get stuck and die. 5: Combat Animations are appalling, actually... they are so bad they are not even there, no dance of death, no special combat conditions animations such as cleave which leaves combat feeling like whack a mole. 6: Character animations are staggered and unrealistic. 7: Music and Sounds have been recycled to an appalling degree. Roughly 95% of the Sounds from NWN have been reused for NWN2, Including Voice Sets and area music. This would have been a sentimental bonus if NWN2 had any of its own music or voice sets, but instead NWN2 rests upon the laurels of NWN. 8: Characters do not always perform cued actions in combat if already attacking. Casting spells from items or using feats/skills is very hit or miss. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't and you and everyone else dies. 9: Death and re-spawn system Makes the OC a Joke on any Difficulty setting, the only real challenge NWN2 poses is dealing with the game stopping bugs and fighting with the UI. 10: Selecting targets in combat is slow and unresponsive meaning that often times instead of meeting a foe and engaging in combat your character will run past the MOB you were attempting to select because you clicked the ground instead. 11: Moving through doorways with any Camera is extremely awkward. 12: The OC Plot line is dull and cliche, with no real emotional connection to the PC. ""Do you know about your mother? No, Oh well Its not my place to tell you, so I wont just yet because its really not my place and its the only character hook we have that we need to reveal much later on so that you feel as if your character and history played some part in the story."" 13: Character heads and hair are hideous and there is an extreme lack of selection. FaceGen could have easily been implemented, even for multiplayer. (Taking a Tip from unreal Tournament and having new user content if missing loaded on a map change.) 14: Character Portraits are as ugly as the heads they belong to. The old Portraits allowed players to be unique and creative. 15: Weapons are very basic and look out of place in comparison to the rest of the world, some of them like the Scythe's look as if they have been directly imported from NWN's with no changes made to update them. 16: The DM Client is awkward, clunky and is missing rudimentary functionality. It almost feels as if basic functions of the DM Client have been locked away from the people trying to use it, making it less of a tool, more a proof of concept. 17: Give/Take Level & XP is Missing from the DM Client. 18: Player Lists or a ""Who's online"" list is missing for both Multiplayer and the DM Client. 19: There is no ""sit on the ground"" animation, it has been replaced with ""Kneel"" which will make RPPW's a somewhat awkward task as most RP took place with people outside, sitting on the ground. 20: Chat Box is tiny and text quickly and easily disappears making Role Play very difficult if interacting with someone who can piece more than 2 words together at a time. 21: Chat ""Rolls up"" from players and disappears far to quickly, once more making in depth RP difficult . 22: Messy and overcomplicated UI for the toolset that makes duel monitors to manage all the menu's not an option but a requirement. 23: Swimming, Climbing and Jumping is absent, there is no real reason as to why these could not have been added. Where is the fun in improved terrain if all you can do is look at it? 24: By the Book adherence to the Rules in 3.5e, like all good DM's Bioware knew when to fudge the rules to make the game a more enjoyable experience. 25: Color Palette for Character creation is extremely limited and forces players into cookie cutter molds. Why not open up all the color options, or even take a step forward and allow people to enter in the html code for the color they want. 26: No fat Character Models, the original NWN's allowed you to choose fat or thin, young or old. 27: No height slider for characters. Its one of the very few ""New"" features of NWN2 so why not let people use it? 28: Dialogue at times in the OC is sometimes downright funny, and not intentionally so. ""Texan"" Swamp farmers and ""Irish"" Wood elves for example. As well as those Lizard Folk running behind the poor farmer with torches like something out of groucho marks. You expect them to have top hats and Cains or cigars. 29: ""Spearhead"" dialogue options that don't even present the illusion of choice, but instead force the player down a predetermined path. Whats the point in presenting multiple dialogue options if they all lead to the same response or some outcome? 30: Walkmeshs must be downloaded for each server without even so much as an automatic download feature. 31: NPC AI is horrific, that means the player must Micromanage everything otherwise NPC's will run off and get themselves (and possibly you killed) or stand around and refusing to engage in combat. 32: Automatic NPC ""Open lock"" or ""Disarm Trap"" fires inconsistantly. Sometimes the animation and voice will fire but the NPC will not actually unlock the door or disarm the trap. 33: Path finding is a joke, for all the walkmesh ""improvements"" the NPC path finding is so poor that the only thing you can be sure of is that if left to there own devices NPC's will either run around in circles or get stuck on an object. 34: WSAD Controls are hyper responsive that makes using WSAD Movement or even changing which direction your facing a difficult and finickety task. 35: Spells all look the same, while what few VFX there are look wonderful, spells no longer feel unique. In NWN's every spell had its own VFX (Even if it was just a culmination of several other VFX's added together) you could tell what was being cast purely by how it looked. Now there are so many spells that look exactly the same that you could be looking at the spell effect for 4 or more different spells. 36: Multiplayer Pausing in the OC is heavy handed and often times completely unnecessary. Not every dialogue is going to break the game, sometimes you just want to open up a merchant. 37: Dialogue Pausing will fire in combat, the rest of the world goes on but the other player not involved in the dialogue can not respond to attacks (They can still get hit and die however.) 38: Screen Turning happens at a snails pace, forcing players to use the middle mouse button if they want to turn the camera. 39: Every Camera Option has a major (and aggravating) issue with it. Top Down will become obstructed by walls or get pushed in so that you cant see anything. Free Camera has no real place in an RPG, even RTS games stopped using it. Chase camera has no way to easily turn around without moving forward & Driving Camera has major issues in interiors and especially doorways with becoming obstructed. 40: No First person perspective option, which makes interior ceilings a mute issue as the camera has to be at such a low angle to see them that it is something you only see when you want to take a screenshot, not when your actually playing. 41: Because the Game Forces you down one path ""Alignment"" and alignment shifts are a mute point. The Only time you get to be evil or attempt to maintain an evil alignment is via very crude and brutal ""Kill them all"" actions instead of ""Talk a little first then kill them all"" good response. 42: No real romance options in the OC, that is and always will be one of the guilty little pleasures of Gamers (Male and female alike3.) 43: NPC's only have enough personality to be annoying, there is no means to interact with them or get to know them. 44: Everything Leaves a loot bag. 45: Chat options are jumbled around or missing. The Old Whisper is now speak making the Talk/Listen radius far to small, the new Whisper is now tell, and DM Chat appears to be missing entirely. 46: No Multiplayer ""Players"" or ""Who's online"" list which makes it especially difficult to find players as a DM. 47: The OC has very little place for your character to be anything other than an Elven/Human Ranger. While you can choose to play any class or race, the story and gameplay all point to Elven/Human Ranger and make you feel a little out of place, going against the grain being anything else. 48: The overall visual Aesthetic looks exactly the same as NWN's especially in interiors, so much so, that unless you are really in close (with exception to lighting) you could mistake them for the same game. This is a shame as the new Graphics engine gets underplayed and understated more often than not. 49: The Toolset is counterintuitive, especially in light of the previous toolset. Powerful does not have to equate to ""Awkward to use."" After over a month of working with it, there are still times I have to stop and think about ""How"" I'm supposed to do something basic. Took 3 weeks to Untrain ""Z"" as Raise/Lower instead of ""Height Lock"" as it is now. In fact, its almost as if every command in the tool set now does the exact opposite of what it did in the old tool set. 50: in the OC NPC's are forced onto you, you have no option but to take them along and eventually dump them in the Tavern. 51: No Vertex Weighting, Hair is static, clothing is static. For a New and improved graphics Engine it seems rather limited when it comes to rendering the characters. 52: Load times are horrific, with 2 gigs of Ram and a 3 GHz processor there is still enough time waiting between loads from one area to the next to make a cup of tea. 53: It feels as if the number of clicks to do the most basic and simple of things has increased exponentially. Click, Drag, press Shift while standing on your head and drag your inventory item to Denmark. 54: Context Sensitive menu delay is far to long, even at its lowest settings its unusable in combat situations. 55: Inventory tetris has been replaced with tiny bland Icons that makes finding something in your inventory almost impossible. It all looks the same and some of the icons in no way shape or form look like the item they are attempting to represent. 56: No Exploration in the OC, An Area ""Opens up"" and appears on your map when what little story there is is forcing you to go there, and even there you can only walk the predetermined path. Even returning to a previous area is fruitless as the NPC's have no life, no spark, nothing to say or add. 57: Resting is still hypersensitive to creature proximity with no relation to the fact that there are 5 walls between you and the creature that you cant rest because of, and because of the way that most of the dungeons are designed, when you need to rest you often have to back track trying every little nook and cranny in the hope that you can find a spot that's ""Just right"" its as bad as trying to get reception on a cellphone in the 90's... can you hear me now? 58: When you die in multiplayer the MOBS do not respond and instead will hover over your corpses so that when you hit ""re-spawn"" they will kill you again... and again... and again... and again... and again. It doesn't add to the ""Difficulty"" but it does make dieing a very aggravating and frustrating experience at times. I would much rather loose some xp than die 40 times in a row due to the 10 archers all aiming for me the instant I re-spawn. 59: Minimap is pretty much useless unless it is to act as a spoiler. 60: No Fog of War except for in interior world spaces, but even then it only applies to unopened doors, as the player can instantly see all the corridors in a dungeon. It must be great to be able to see around corners. (Once more, poor area design) 61: You have to buy and sell items individually. Selling or buying potions one after the other after the other is extremely aggravating. What happened to ""How many would you wish to buy/sell"" I mean hell... if even Pokemon Emerald can add that basic functionality to merchants why cant NWN2? 62: In game books have no personality, they used to feel like you were reading a scroll, now the book text looks like yet another pop up menu. 63: In game Cut scenes have no volume control, dialogue will be really quiet and then very very loud then quiet again. 64: Cut scene cameras have been poorly placed and do not seem very streamlined or tested, sometimes your looking at the NPC's leg, sometimes the Sky, your characters arm or the back of there head or the screen is cut in half because its partly buried in the ground. 65: There is no feeling of contact in combat, blades pass through MOB's, spells fire and red numbers flash and that's about it, sometimes if your lucky you will get a reaction hit. 66: No ability to be naked, or even semi naked. Characters are in a permanently clothed state... did GTA:SA Scare people that much that now even undies are taboo? 67: You can no longer assign an auto function for an item on the quick slot bar. In NWN's you could select that an item would cast light, or heal or whatever... now you have to go via the Context Sensitive menu which makes using items a pain in the arse. 68: The VFX for Light spells (IE The glowing orbs above the players head) get in the way in any camera mode where the camera is not really far back or high up. 69: No Sneak Animation. 70: Animations do not always fire (Which seems to be a problem carried over from NWN's.) You Will stand over an Object when you should be Kneeling, or ""Open"" animations will fire after the door is already open etc. 71: +1 Items are still the gawdawful ""Copper"" color meaning that normal items are still more aesthetically pleasing and look more ""real"" than items that are 100x there value. This is more a personal dislike and distaste from the original. 72: Not enough random loot in the OC, you Kill X Mob and get Y item way to often, which makes replaying the OC none to thrilling. 73: The ""Seamless"" transition space for areas is wasted more often than not in the OC and adds unneeded Bulk to user mods which compresses the problems faced by PW creators due to the module size limitations because NWN2 acts like a bloated tick when it comes to areas. 74: The World Map Transition Icon is large, garish, destroys immersion and is often times placed in a position where you have to move the camera behind the transition otherwise all the PC will do is open and close the transition doors that the Map transition is sitting on. 75: No Mounts or Mounted Combat, something that was achieved for NWN's late in its life and was a promised feature of NWN2, so much so that it appears on the presale box. 76: Only 2 Dragons that can only be moderately tinted. 77: Tinting for Buildings and Creatures is extremely limited, often only being the roof or the buildings trim and a great many buildings or placeables cannot be tinted at all. 78: Hair styles are almost the same for every race which does very little for character diversity. 79: More quest bugs than you can shake a stick at, everything from the Game Crashing when attempting to load a cut scene, to quests repeating themselves over and over again even after you have completed them. 80: NPC Death/respawn system sometimes gets stuck and your NPC's will not automatically stand back up after combat, cant be healed and cant be raised... and you cant leave the area you are in to get aid so your left with only the option to reload from a previous save and hope they don't die, and if they do... that they stand back up again. 81: Impossible to open doors have been placed in seemingly ""key"" areas and where MOB's can still attack you. 82: Game is artificially limited to 20 levels (much like DVD regions) references are made to Epic Level feats in the 2da's and there are even feat Scripts left in from HotU. While this has little effect on the OC it could of had a great deal of effect on Multiplayer. 83: Most of the ""New"" Content in terms of feats and PrC's seems to be taken directly from The Players Resource Consortium. While I know it all comes from the same fount, it just seems a little odd that things the Community had already added and had become popular and Successful make it into NWN2. So many PrC's and feats to choose from and yet the same ones keep on cropping up. While I know this is because both draw from 3.5e and both listened to the Community's demands... I cant seem to shake the feeling of ""Been there done that, that's new? I thought that was always in NWN?"" and I half expect to open up the tool set and see the same scripts from PRC in NWN2. 84: Quest Giver NPC's feel as if they are fighting with you in order to give you the quest they are forcing on you. Your trying to go from A-B and NPC X appears out of no where and demands or whines you into doing quest Z and you have to sit through 20 layers of the same repeating dialogue in order for you to mark the next area you have to get to. Sometimes it actually seems it takes longer to get the quest than it does to complete it. While I have no problem with dialogue (What is an RPG without dialogue?) the quest givers just feel stilted and like they are dragging it out for everything its worth to the point that your hitting ""1"" just to get through the same convoluted tripe once more. Give me with detail, depth and story, don't bore me with reiterating the same point or goal from the same NPC et infinitum to the point that the quest is a dead horse long before it has begun. 85: The US Limited Edition is a Joke, The Rings are Incredibly Cheap. I mean, I was Expecting Cheap, but not Cracker Jack Cheap, and just who's fingers are the rings supposed to fit? To large for a kid, to small for an adult. The Cloth Map is Tiny and Thin and the Concept Art Booklet is all Screenshots or Tiny little Sketches that would have actually been of interest were they not half an inch by half an inch in Size. Compared to the UK version getting The Original NWN With Expansions, we seriously got jipped. Granted that is all the Publishers deal and in a year they will probably sell ""NWN Complete"" Packaging NWN/SoU/HotU, NWN2 & All premium Modules just before Obsidian releases there first expansion for NWN2. 86: The Run animations for duel wield make the PC's look like Bella Lagousey as Dracula, trying to shield his face from the sun. 87: Cloaks look horrible, not only are they once again paper thin but the way they attach to the PC's shoulders leave you looking directly through the ""Loop"" at the shoulders if your not wearing armor with huge pauldrons to hide it. 88: There is no feeling of Travel between Areas as the world map is tiny, they feel like exactly what they are, which cheap and Dirty fast travel options between instanced areas. Even Fallout went so far as to give you a little dotted line between point a-b and the option to stop off or have an honest to god, truly random encounter.. not just a planned encounter popping up before you can go to the next predetermined area. 89: NPC's have no Spark of life about them in terms of NPC to NPC interaction. They are extremely scripted, so much so that if and when they do spuraticly spout a line of dialogue its as if they are looking for there blacking marks on the ground and holding up there script. ""Hold on guys I think I have a line here.. Ok here it goes. We have now reached the City of Neverwinter, You two pissed me off on the journey... no don't actually bother responding to me or having an actual discussion with me about anything, and I'm not actually going to go anywhere like I said I would but instead stick to the group"" In KotOR, NPC's would stop and have conversations with each other depending upon who you had in the party and where you were or what actions your character had just made. NWN2 lacks even that small amount of depth giving you no way to interact with your companions except when the game occasionally allows you to have a dialogue option or two with them... which generally has no effect on them, they do what they were going to do anyway and you either loose or gain influence for agreeing or disagreeing with them. Granted they are a hell of a lot better than the original NWN's but in comparison to even KotOR2 they have a great deal to answer for. Even the abortion of the TES Series that was Oblivion managed to give the NPC's some personality, so Radiant AI was not very advanced but it at least made an attempt. 90: Interior Tile sets are extremely limited, while It is nice that we can fit together different tiles in some sembalance of a master List, that does not excuse the fact that there are crucial... key tilesets missing. Sewers for example. While I understand you only added what you would need for the OC it still leaves the modding Community high and dry on some tileset basics. 91: One of the worst crafting systems ever conceived. Having to Buy ""Molds"" for everything you want to create... you don't cast anything in a Mould, Weapons and Armor are tempered, not Poured. Has no one at Obsidian ever been to a Blacksmiths Forge or even to your run of the mill Ren fair? Its a quick and Dirty Craft system ripped mostly from KotOR because every RPG apparently has to have one. 92: The OC is totally Monty Haul, Swamp Farmers with +1 Weapons, Low Level Lizard Folk with Flaming/Lighting/Whatever weapons. Oh look, I found another +4 Burning Sword of Doom, toss it onto the pile we have going. 93: The Cityscape of the City of Neverwinter is bland, uninteresting and placeables seem to be tossed around randomly. Why is there a mini Obelisk in the middle of the road? Why do the Docks have a Gazebo? Why are all the doors missing? I mean, I understand not wanting to make an interior for each building you place, but surely a tiny little cell with an NPC to talk to... oh that",JohnS.

No traps, no enemies, no spectacular jump sequences like in the old trilogy anymore. Thus no thrill at all. It also became so easy that only casual gamers might be pleased. You can't die anymore. Elika will always save you and ""teleport"" you back. The Prince also does pretty much automatically compared to its prequels. You usually just have to press the jump button over and over again and every now and then a 2nd button to make a longer jump, a 3rd to grap a ring to reach higher areas. When you have collected enough lightballs to enter a new area you first have to fight against a boss. Very boring because you can't do anything else then blocking (and waiting) when he starts a series of attacks. Then you do your usual prince-elika-prince-elika-prince attack and you are done. No more stunning acrobatics and combos like in ""Warrior Within"". Oh, and you have to fight the bosses multiple times ... . The short dialogues are also crappy because they are just meaningless and awkward. They have the same entertainment value like doing your taxes. Plus this game basically has no story at all. I think the only reason it became such high ratings is because of its graphics style.",JohnS.

Next to ""Splinter Cell"", ""Unreal"" and ""Halo"", you won't find more riveting graphics and character renderings. Gameplay is also good and realistic -- you never storm into a place, and must rely on strategy, sniping, and covering your AI teammates to complete any mission. ""Normal"" dificulty is very hard! Fortunately, you have easy, normal, hard to swap between. Fully customizable controls, smart AI, and a lack of FPS cliches (boss monsters, indestructible characters, run-shoot-kill-kill-kill-everything scenarios) round up a satisfying shooter that requires more brains than brawn. So, it's a slower pace than ""Halo"" and more rooted in reality. Expect to crawl around with a rifle more than jumping into the fray with your Thompson machine gun. Multiplayer is a welcome addition, but they should have spent more time on it. The levels and options are good, but no system link capability and no bots means 4 players is the limit. Moreover, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch are the only game variations! How disappointing. Because of its challenge and its terrific look/gameplay/music/setting, this is a game that begs for Xbox Live, co-op, and more mutliplayer variety; I hope they build upon it in future releases. Still, its a good one-player game that compares favorably to ""Timesplitters 2"", which has robust multiplayer capabilities but lacks the solid one-player story, sound, textures, realism, and graphics that ""MOH"" excels at -- it's a better crafted game. But remember that this is a slower, more challenging game that is more solo entertainment.",JohnS.

You may find yourself frequently sitting back to watch yet another cinematic, but you'll rarely find yourself not wanting watch the next one.  The story starts relatively simple and quickly becomes complex and engrossing.There are some aspects that are could use some work.  Even with character ability customization, sometimes the battles can feel tedious and repetitive.  Some people also would also prefer background music as most games often have (I am not one of them, however).Currently I have a PS4 sitting not 20 feet away from me, but I frequently find myself returning to this game and the series as whole because I enjoy the games and the story that much.  I'll grant that this review is a bit late, but I would strongly suggest this game to people that enjoy RPGs",IJL711

While it does rely on some old tropes and doesn't reinvent the wheel, it does take an approach to the rpg story that we don't often get; the evil side.  You work for ""evil"" from the start and have to carve your path from there.Having said that, the game does a very good job of making you wonder if what you're doing is truely bad or if it's good; there really isn't a true ""good"" or ""evil"" action in the game.  A lot of the characters have their own justifications for their actions that seem perfectly reasonable given the circumstances in which they are embroiled.  Even still, it can be difficult to make some decisions that are either terrible or you have your own idea and you wish you could implement it (but you said the wrong word two dialogue options ago).The problem with the story (and problably, but just in case, spoiler warning) is that it just kind of...ends.  It is very clear that there either is or should be more to it.  You can tell that it's coming, but you hold onto the hope that surely it doesn't.  We certainly want our resolution of the story.  That being said, a proper resolution feels like it would take another full game.If you've played Pillars of Eternity, then you already know the score with the combat.  Now, I don't know if it's possible but I never figured out how to change the hotkeys for combat... Either way, this takes a lot of pausing, issuing commands, starting for a second, issuing some more commands, etc. ad nauseam.  If you want go go go combat, then it is not for you.  However, if you like to stategize and coordinate or if you're impartial then it IS for you.Long story short, I really like this game.  I've played it through once and I intend to play it through at least one more time, possibly more.Pros:-Dark but engaging story with fleshed out lore-Choices have a lasting impact and may haunt/aid you down the road-Strategic combatCons:-Story abrubtly ends in what kind of feels like the middle-While companions have their own stories, they just kind of follow blindly as long as you say the right thing once or twice",IJL711

236166,Transistor,PC,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        From the confusing beginning, all the way until the creepy chick-flick ending, this game never felt ""right"", not like Bastion did. By the time ""Red"" decided to suicide, an outcome I cherished since I never felt connected to her like I did with the ""Kid"", I couldn't wait until the weird pictures stopped rolling, and then in turn, the credits, to see if there is something else; something else that was coming that could salvage what little hope I had by that point in this production. Alas, there was not. Merely a game-plus mode that would put me through the whole ordeal again. However, all is not lost. The production did contain certain aspects that made me feel my $20 wasn't a complete wash down the toilet, such as beautiful art-work, mesmerizing music, and a some-what interesting combat system. Nothing much else beside that I'm afraid. The list of the things I found lacking follows below:- Extremely easy and casual that it even makes games such as Child of Light feel hardcore in comparison. I haven't died once throughout the entire game, which is a huge contrast coming from Dark Souls 2, as one can imagine. I did get over-loaded a couple of times at least. I remember Bastion becoming challenging with all Idols enabled, requiring a change in strategy to survive, not so with Transistor. Enabling 5 out of the 6 ""limiters"" I acquired through-out the game did nothing in terms of adding any meaningful challenge. It seems, to me at least, that the game was heavily tailored towards the female and casual players demographic.- Extremely short. Not the game as whole only, but even the battles in-between. One could literally finish most battles in under a minute, and often times without getting as much as a scratch in the process.- Lackluster enemies/bosses. I could swear there were only around 7-8 enemy types in the entire game, which gets ""leveled-up"" with time, instead of the game giving us new enemy types, which I must, with apologies, attribute to lazy development. If I'm not mistaken, I believe there was a total of only three bosses thought-out the entire game, each being a complete cake-walk. If there was a fourth one, my bad, but they're just so forgettable. I do remember there being some sort of an umbrella in the mix somewhere.- Meaningless optional additions. The beach where you go to do challenges and practice is so meaningless and boring that I decided to skip it entirely after the third-one. The terminals you encounter throughout the game serve nothing; they could literally be completely gone and nothing would be lost or gained in terms of substance. The cut scenes where you are riding a bike, a boat and finally what I'm assuming to be some sort of cloud made out from Processes, does nothing but extend the game-length for a couple of minutes. Then, there's the button that you press to make the girl hum a song and the button you press to make her jump and catch her weird, glowing sword; I'm yet scratching my head to try and fathom what the point of adding all this non-sense was.- Very Interesting upgrade system, where each acquired skill could be used as an active skill, a supplement skill or a passive skill, but it is too simplistic. Bastion's upgrade system was much more cohesive. Each gun you acquired had its strengths and weaknesses against certain enemy types. In Transistor, I beat the game with the same 4 active slots I acquired at the beginning, and without giving much thought to what I put as supplements or passives.Finally, I must complement Supergiant for another artistic achievement; you have clearly put your soul and heart into this, although I feel it was transferred through the wrong medium. It might serve better if someone transfers it as a romantic sci-fi book or movie than it ever does as a game.",MohJ

The bots are average, though I have yet to see good video game AI in any game.  The side quests are immersive and entertaining.  The characters are relatable and your relationships with them are believable.  You don't have to micromanage your squad's weapons, armor, and mods anymore (thank God) and this makes the game much more streamlined, even if it's more of an FPS as a result.The Bad:  The story seems too short and it's like Bioware stuck in the loyalty missions just to add length to the game.  That's not to say that these missions aren't rewarding or entertaining; in fact they're better than some of the plot missions.  The final battle is disappointingly easy when compared to the final battle in ME1 and it was actually harder to get to the room where it takes place than to actually win the fight.  I also did not like how they took out the driving portions of the game.  Now, I know most people hated driving that car in ME1, but I liked it, and it was certainly better than just scanning the planet for the resources you need.The Ugly: (DISCLAIMER: Some of these issues may have been due to the fact that my computer is slightly underpowered and not due to the actual game.)  Blinking still looks freakin weird with eyelids and eye lashes overlapping and showing through each other and just being a bit disturbing.  Occasionally, if I was walking too close to a wall that had kind of a slope, I'd get stuck on it and wouldn't be able to move.  Facial expressions look odd and slightly robotic, but the voice acting makes up for it so I'm good.  Sometimes during a cut scene the camera would go inside Shepard or some other character and obstruct my view until the camera moved a little.  Very rarely (like once or twice) the game would lock up for 30 to 45 seconds inside the Normandy, but then it kept moving and everything was fine.Overall, I absolutely loved this game.  It has definitely moved to the Number 1 spot on my list of Best Games Ever, beating out Twilight Princess.  Buy it. NOW.",Nickompoop

Trust is the center of the games message, and it reminds us of that several times.The villain of the game is kind of bland, he reminds me of the main villains of the previous games, in fact he does so a lot.It's good, however it could have been better.Action is decent, ok weapon feel. Just ok though, nothing great, however i think very few people buy this game for the action.

I really hope lots of people were fired over this game. Why in the world would Cid Meier put his name on this steaming pile of monkey Crap!Take Civ V, strip away 80% of the content, slap a coat of Sci-Fi paint on it and ship it out the door.Very disappointing. Beyond Earth should have been sold as a Civ V mod for a fraction of the price. This game has slightly more content and replayability than the Steampunk DLC released for Civ V.There are only 8 civs to choose from, but that doesn't matter because they are effectively identical anyway.There are only about 8-10 units in the game, and it's the same 8-10 units regardless of which civ you choose.The landscape is crowded with features and resources that have very little purpose. You can comfortably set your Workers on auto and ignore them.All 5 Victory Paths are Science driven, making everything else largely irrelevant. Even the Domination Victory depends heavily on the Science resource in order to unlock the automatic upgrades for the 2 or 3 units you will need to win.Trade is crucial to success, but very tedious and not fun at all to manage. Every turn, I would get 1 or 2 messages from Trade units asking me to confirm that I still want it to keep doing what I told it to do the last 20 times it asked.Diplomacy is irrelevant. All other Civs can be safely ignored unless you feel like conquering them. Other leaders will frequently harass you with pointless offers or empty threats, though, and that gets annoying fast.Exploration is largely pointless and unrewarding.

I have a habit of trailing the trend, and this allows me to use effectively get the best bang out of every buck I spend on games as I usually end up picking out games with the very best reviews.Originally, I was very skeptical of Mass Effect. I've played Bioware games before, and they usually left me with a terrible impression. Mass Effect, on the other hand, was surprisingly incredible.Mass Effect is actually a trilogy game if you didn't already know that, but what you may not know is that, it is meant to be played all 3 in succession. If you're going to buy ME, you better be prepared to buy the complete set, because they're all interwoven so well, that if you only buy one or two, you'll always feel like you're missing something.And it is exactly that, that makes ME trilogy so attractive.It reminds me of the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books I enjoyed so much when I was young.Your regular choices regularly affect everything and everyone around you, just as you would in the real world. And once you've chosen, you can consequently see your choices being played out through the trilogy.Unlike games like Skyrim, while you're free to pursue whatever activities you so prefer. The game doesn't presume a specific personality or allow you to presume as one. So while the freedom is there, and while there are literally hundreds of NPCs for you to meet, and thousands more dialogue to hear..at best, it only feels like a television show just being played out with you on the passive receiving end.The feeling is different, even different from Deus Ex. In Deus Ex, while you have choices of different responses and actions, they ultimately come off only as techniques of persuasions but the same personality is being still used.In ME, like in the real world, you will encounter really tough situational questions. Even while your personality will naturally reflect your usual responses, but there will still be the odd time where you will wonder what it would be like to be an ""alpha"" male? Or whether there is a way to change your superior's bad impression of your character? Or you want to learn a few techniques in reading in-between the lines? You know, the useful day-to-day conversation skills that you never learn anywhere else (short of countless social blunders)! Those dangerous words and actions that you've always wanted to say, but couldn't for fear of irreparable damage to your self image and relationships.ME's good like that, and that's why I think it stands out above the rest.Granted, the massive freedom, for say Skyrim, allows the game to have massive replay value, whereas a game like Mass Effect, you'll probably only play through it once, twice at best.But, based on the combined quality of material presented, good graphics, voice acting, seamless gameplay, and most importantly, the interactive story, is well worth the price tag of being played through even just once.",Aeruja

Perhaps due to the rather stringent starting conditions that you were given, and the huge tactical advantage the enemy possessed.Under those reviews, they talked about inventory management affecting movement and reload speeds, manual lighting, and targettable cover, all of which sounds pretty interesting without a doubt, some of which even made me feel like I was missing out on.However, that doesn't necessarily make this a poor game, certainly not 0, even if you were trying to downvote..which isn't necessary at all, the good reviews themselves aren't all 10s anyways. And an 8 feels pretty justified in my books.This is a great turn-based game. Graphics are decent, too.The story is short, and is somewhat linear, as with its game progression.Since the achievements are based on replayability, the storyline is kinda overlooked.The game progression however, feels constrained. Especially on the harder levels where every level pretty much fights the same if you want your team to come out in one piece.Now if there were a bit more leeway in the characters themselves, a few more special moves in the higher tier skills to compensate their weaknesses a bit more, that would make the gameplay much more flexible and enjoyable.Other than that, it's a fun solid game.

135689,The Stanley Parable,PC,1,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I have not bought this game, nor will I ever consider buying this game for the price listed during this Christmas sale (9.99). It is not worth it.Originally, the mystery behind all the narration and ambiguous description captured my interest as I tend to attempt to unravel the truths from the untruths via internet browsing and reviews. I like to know what my game is like especially when I'm spending this amount of money to buy a game with steam engine graphics....it was a disappointment. The game's air of enigma was easily blown away with Youtube videos about 6 particular endings and a very short storyline, and even when I tried to dig deeper, there were other endings, but sadly, not enough. And certainly not worth the price tag, when you try to compare to other games with vastly superior and unique graphics and gameplay also at the same price or lower.Sure, it might seem new and interesting the first few runs, but really, it's not really so much of a game than it is just a couple of seemingly clever plot twists and mind games. And we're not talking about the deep philosophical and psychological games..just a couple of basic ones, which may have appealed to some of the mainstream critics as a masterpiece at first, and is probably all that was needed to spark their overhyped reviews.",Aeruja

Even if a particular mission fails, there is no heavy penalty, everyone keeps all the guns and cars they've collected and everyone can feel free to retry at their leisure. No pressure at all, which is a total refreshment for all the serious and heavy gaming expects everyone to heavily invest in a gamble to risk losing one thing or another. Not that it is a bad thing necessarily, but it really relieves the hassle of that in this casual environment.The story itself is relatively short, but that's only to provide an introduction into this sandbox world I believe. The main focus was never really the story, but the world itself. The story however, is just content to introduce all the game mechanics SR3 had to offer. Not to mention the wackiness and humor that you just won't get to see on a regular basis. Pimps riding on chariots? A giant ball of yarn wrecking havoc? A game show devoted to slaughter mascots? Not intended to humor children and mindful sticklers, but if you were, you wouldn't pick up a game about gangstas in the first place, unless your only intent is to patronize it.Overall, it is a game that's well deserved its full marks, simply just because it has managed to capture this player's undivided attention until all missions and almost all achievements (96%) have been completed for 252 hours.",Aeruja

Paired with fantastic voice acting and great pacing, it takes you on a emotional journey that will make you want to delve into the main plot more and more. As for the side content, it has TONS, which is both good and bad. Some of the side missions are fun and interesting, with dynamic characters, while other missions are clearly in there for padding. As for the gameplay itself, Horizon takes many elements from other popular game franchises, and sort of mashes it all into one. Not necessarily bad, but unfortunately, doing so made the gameplay experience not feel as unique. For instance, it feels like a mix of Far Cry, Assassins Creed, and The Witcher into one game. The robotic dinosaurs felt cool and interesting for sure, but sadly, it wasn't enough to merit a completely unique gameplay experience. On the other hand, the environment in this game was very done. Every small detail and design made the game truly come to life, and of course the amazing graphics blow you away. Overall, if you're looking for a game with an absolutely incredible story, Horizon Zero Dawn is for you. If you're looking for a game that has a truly different gameplay experience, you may not find it here, but I digress, this game is worth your time if you own a PS4.",TheDarkAssassin

First and foremost, the game has A LOT of content which I feel we don't get much anymore from games nowadays. Everywhere I went in the game, there was almost always a side mission or place to loot, so Mankind Divided definitely delivered on the amount of content. I really love the fact that you have so many different ways to do things, and of course you can either go stealthy or loud. The dialogue in the game makes sense and actually has a lasting effect on the story and NPCs, versus other games (like Fallout 4 in my opinion) that did not. I like the array of augmentations for Adam, and the gunplay felt smooth as well. I thought the main story was very interesting, but on a negative note, felt that it could of been developed a bit more. When I finished the game, I felt disappointed because I felt that that it ended very abruptly, and so I definitely feel they could have expanded on the main story more. I also did not like the main/final boss. In fact, it didn't even feel like a boss fight, but rather a fight with just a slightly stronger ""normal"" enemy. It wasn't very challenging or fun, and I didn't get that satisfaction from beating a boss when it was over. The game also did have some framerate drops here and there, but nothing too significant in my experience (I did play the game on the PS4). I don't know how Mankind Divided compares to Human Revolution, since I didn't play the previous game, but in my opinion, I thought Mankind Divided was a pretty good game, and compared to some other games that have come out recently, is definitely worth it.",TheDarkAssassin

Like most people, I hated the first game and I almost completely skipped Watch Dogs 2 because of it. I have to say, I am really glad I didn't. This game is the polar opposite to the first one. First of all, the main protagonist in the game is a lot more interesting and upbeat versus Aiden Pierce in the first game. There is LOTS of humor in this game, but still some serious moments where it is appropriately leveled out. Tons of really fun and interesting missions, with a huge array of side content, so there's never really a dull moment during the gameplay experience. Not only that, but the variety of the missions are great as well. The game never felt boring or repetitive the entire time I was playing it. The game being set in San Francisco adds much more excitement with all the cool scenery. The game includes tons of upbeat music and even some cool interactions between civilians on the street. The story was amazing, with the right pacing and tone. It didn't feel rushed at the end like some games do. I also love the fact that you have a remote control car and drone to use. You can use these items to mark enemies, go through vents to get to areas you wouldn't be able to access normally, and even use them to hack certain items. There are so many cool details in this game, it's hard to name them all here. Overall, Ubisoft did a really amazing job with this one, and I couldn't of had more fun playing it.",TheDarkAssassin

Gameplay is horrid if you can get past the graphics.There are little to no guns in the game; no where near what COD games usually have. Players are miniscule even on my 60in plasma to the point where characters are only 1-2 widths of the red dot. Players move at hyper speeds making it really hard to hit anything that moves. The hitboxes are seriously messed up where in some situations you dont actually have to aim at the guy just random spraying works and its quite obvious in the replays. When aiming it sometimes feels like theres only 1-2 hitboxes but then you realize that the players are so small you probably wont hit anything except when your dead on. This is the first FPS i've ever played where netcode actually rewards laggers. Meaning your shots dont register at all. The cloak of the nanosuit is so powerful that it just breaks gameplay. You must have it on at all times to the point where you'll never have a positive score if you dont use it. The maps just blow, they're sprawling and way too big for the number of players to the point where you dont see anything for like half the match.Overall most people are right its nothing like COD, the minor finer details that made COD great, the flow the good maps the plethora of guns made it great. All these things are missing in crysis 2 instead they have crude gameplay wrapped up in a nanosuit and good graphics.Overall graphics are an 8+ gameplay is max a 2.",incognito

Maps, which have yet to make anybody happy except the stereotypical expert player, in which huge open ranges allow for 110-rank players to sit and annihilate your entire team regardless of what part of the map you spawn in. Vehicles are now more overpowered and the lesser ones now made worse. Jets are now invincible, travel at the speed of light, and cannot be shot down by anything, and helicopters now require you to run away whenever you enter any open area because any engineer with two rockets in a rocket launcher can take YOUR ONE FLARE and reload faster. Tanks, previously effective anti-infantry vehicles, previously 'fair' in BF3, are now not even weak enough to be called a 'tank'. Several of the secondary more-powerful anti-tank mines will only disable movement. Anti-aircraft, a vehicle whose purpose was completely obliterated when people now use the heavy machine guns in order to mow down infantry, and end up camping in their spawn locations (which you cannot enter.) Alongside a whole other set of unbearable problems, like a rocket artillery you find campers hiding in spawns, can also take down piles of infantry. Tanks can now carry two different types of different, more advanced shells, both overpowered to the max. Anybody who likes BF3 (Or any previous) should take a big look before they purchase this game.

I was a fan of Star Wars as a kid, but would have to say I am now a converted Mass Effect fan. Bioware has created a world that rivals the Star Wars Universe in terms of depth, history and memorable characters. I think the story is just so brilliant, and the characters are so deep and compelling that it will hard for any game to challenge this for a very long time. I would usually say I can't wait for this game to be turned into a movie, but this game is so perfect I think every person who plays it realizes that it pretty much already is a film, a rich world that is pure escapism.

This game plays incredibly smoothly, the load times are negligible, and the scenery is beautiful with very little noticeable pop-in. The draw distance was pushed back quite a bit for the PS3 version and the trees look a lot nicer on the scenery (don't ask my why I noticed). This game is just as incredible as it's other consoled/PC counterparts. It's engrossing, it's long, and if you haven't played Oblivion before, it's just the kind of game your PS3 needs. Only negative I can really think of is the fact that we have no downloadable content as of yet, but from what I understand, the developers are working on it.",KyleT.

This game, while not much like previous Burnouts, is a beast of its own. The single player mode is expansive and incredibly entertaining. Exploring isn't a MUST per-se, but it's obviously a large part of the game. The multiplayer is a beast of it's own.

The single player mode is expansive and incredibly entertaining. Exploring isn't a MUST per-se, but it's obviously a large part of the game. The multiplayer is a beast of it's own. Not only is it incredibly fun just racing with up to 7 other people, the 50 challenges for each class (350 in all) really flesh out the experience. The challenges involve stuff as mundane as boosting for a few seconds and escalate all the way up to performing group barrel rolls through the fuselages of planes at an abandoned airfield. The only things that I would even think of criticizing about the game are a lack of custom soundtrack in the PS3 (which was sort of a no-brainer...no idea why that didn't happen), the inability to ""restart"" a race (I know it doesn't allow for as much exploration, but driving back to a starting point to restart a difficult race over and over is a humongous pain.), and POSSIBLY the removal of crash mode. Although I think showtime has a ton of promise with random friend gatherings (beating scores, bouncing around etc), old fashioned crash mode will be missed. I'll be playing this game for a while. Online and off. Don't trust the user score and try the demo yourself before you make a judgment.

I agree that a few of the side missions are a bit tedious (following the courier comes to mind), but what game HASN'T had tedious side missions of some sort? The replayability is a tiny bit above Grand Theft Auto 4, with a whole set of new missions for an ""evil"" playthrough, Cutscenes, while sparse graphically, are still interesting and fit the story perfectly. The ""comic book"" feel is really prevalent and I enjoy it thoroughly. Combat and controls are EXCELLENT. While still challenging when thirty people are shooting at you from surrounding rooftops, it's easy to feel like a superhero when you do a charged drop on a group of bad guys and spin around shooting bolts of electricity everywhere. Incredibly satisfying too. Honestly, I'm a bit wary of people who have rated this below a 7.5. Not that I don't believe that they have their own opinions, but out of all of them, Eurogamer is the only site that has had any sort of justification other than ""I don't like it, it sucks"" generalities and various nitpicks.

The  ""Player-driven"" economy has been completely destroyed by cheaters.  Exploits, bots, hacks, and scams are widely used, and Blizzard does little to nothing to discipline these cheaters.  Technical support is almost non-existent. If you are hacked or scammed, Blizzard will write you a generic e-mail claiming there is nothing they can or will do.  Graphics and music are mediocre at best.  Game mechanics have been completely dumbed-down to a 12 year old's level.  You'll breeze through the first 3 difficulty levels then hit a brick wall in ""Inferno Difficulty"".  You'll then be forced to farm for gold for countless hours to use the Auction House where the economy is completely inflated and corrupted.  It will influence some to use Blizzard's ""Real-money auction house"", where you'll literally have to spend hundreds of dollars just to get an edge.  CO-OP play is greatly discouraged because of flawed game-play mechanics.  Chat channels are completely flooded with spammers trying to sell gold for real money.  Community is horrible; forums are filled with angry, disappointed customers; rightfully so.  Game-play is only smooth in between ""rubber-banding"", you'll start walking and it will glitch, pulling your character back to it's original position.  Random disconnections take place.  No offline single-player mode.  No character customization besides gender and dye. Has no replay value what-so-ever.  Looked forward to this game for 8+ years; HUGE disappointment.    I am simply flabbergasted that Blizzard was capable of releasing such a poor quality game.  This game would not have sold so many copies if it wasn't for Diablo 2.

Instead I gave it 5/10 and still feel like I'm being generous.  Please allow me to explain how I reached this conclusion.Upon leaving the vault and entering the wasteland, it feels like every other Fallout title.  You can't wait to explore unique locations, find stronger weapons, get your first suit of power armor; ultimately, finish quests with the best possible outcome.  Whether your character is good, evil, or neutral- your choices effect what kind of ending you get.My first impressions of Fallout 4 were pretty good.  Graphics were improved, the main story was interesting, side quests reaped good rewards, gameplay was smooth (aside from a few bugs).  I thought the settlements provided a nice break from questing and exploring.  There was only 2 things that really bothered me.  (1)The new perk/stat/skill allocation system being one of them.  I felt like I had way less control over the development of my character.  (2)Dialog options.  With only having 4 dialog options, it severely limited the role playing aspect of the game.  Obviously, this change was implemented for console gamers and/or casual players with a short attention spans.As with all my first playthroughs- no guides, no forums, no spoilers.  Since I did not read or discuss Fallout 4, I remained blissfully ignorant throughout most of the game.  I started getting a little nervous after doing 20+ quests for each of the factions.  I found myself asking, ""Um, when is this quest-line going to end?... this is getting repetitive"".  Shortly after, I realized these must be repeatable quests and I'm just wasting my time.I decided to continue the main quest and explore more.  The progression of the main quest was a bit anti-climatic and predictable.  Suddenly, every location seemed generic and heavily repeated.  I had 20+ settlements and they constantly asked for help.  Building became boring the second I learned how limited and inconsequential it was.  After a while, I dreaded finding new settlements.It kept getting easier and easier.  I periodically upped the difficult level until I was maxed out on survival by level 50.  The amount of HP and armor enemies had made my weapon and armor selection extremely limited.  Combat remained easy, but it became a chore.  Around this time, I didn't need anything.  Caps, stimpaks, ammo, armor, weapons, ect. were all a ""non-issue.""  I was carting junk for my pointless settlements, that's about it.The final push was painful.  After finding as many locations and completing as many quests that I could, it was time to finally beat the game.  Around level 80, I saved before I became enemies with anyone significant so I could reload in order to explore other ""possibilities.""  There was a cut-scene.  Then there was confusion.  I couldn't understand.  I literally had to Google to make sure what I saw was the actual ending.  Then I reloaded and beat it 2 other ways.  I sat in awe as I realized how inconsequential every decision I made was.  All those speech checks, settlements, and side-quests.  I could have ignored 95% of the content and would have gotten the same vague, asinine ending.I picked up the few achievements I missed; closed the game and said good-bye for good.  I've played every Fallout (besides Fallout Tactics) and this is the first one to have zero point zero replayability.  I agree with the common consensus that it's not bad game, but it's not a great game either.  As many have stated, it's less immersive and lacks the ""RP"" in ""RPG"".  That's why I give it a 5/10 for it's complete mediocrity.For fans of Fallout 1 & 2, I recommend you check out Wasteland 2; if you haven't already.  I enjoyed Wasteland 2 more than Fallout 4, which might sound crazy to some.  Honestly, I wish Bethesda would bring Brian Fargo back to the Fallout Series.  Pipe dream, really.  Let's just hope this isn't Bethesda's ""Jump the Shark"" moment.",SpazeGoat

As it is, I'm on a second playthrough already. They did a great job of making you feel that no matter how skilled you play the game, Lara may not actually succeed at her goals. Pros:TressFX hair.The island is the star.Great pacing to the story and to Lara's development as a character.Nice job of making the player feel that they may not succeed at their mission until the last second. Cons:Massive performance drop with TressFX hair on (don't use this on anything but a top Intel chip processor and AMD 6970+ or NVIDIA GFX 660ti  card, it killed every other set up I used).No puzzles (well they exist, but are short and very easy).Water could be better and Lara can't swim.Freedom of movement around the island comes very late in the story at which point you don't care about exploring any more. PC controls are not as smooth as the controller, again making the PC feel like an afterthought. Many people complain of crashes, but I had a smooth experience. Final Judgment:It is worth the $50 only if you like replaying games. It is short and a one time play for people only interested in the story.

109501,Guild Wars,PC,8," Everyone here and beyond has thier opinions, I know, but I believe this is the best MMORPG on the market. I have had a little experience with Ever Quest, and a WHOLE lot of experience with World of Warcraft. Guild Wars should continue to be better with updates, fixes, balances, and expansions, just like every other persitent online game. Guild Wars sets itself apart in a few good Everyone here and beyond has thier opinions, I know, but I believe this is the best MMORPG on the market. I have had a little experience with Ever Quest, and a WHOLE lot of experience with World of Warcraft. Guild Wars should continue to be better with updates, fixes, balances, and expansions, just like every other persitent online game. Guild Wars sets itself apart in a few good respects: -The updating is painless. No need to download huge patches. It patches small parts of the game as you load different areas. Very nice. Nothing worse than jumping on to play a little of your game to realize that you have to spend the next 30 - 60 mins downloading and patching before you can jump on and play like in WOW. -The gameplay is fun and tailored more toward skill. You do have to spend some time leveling up your character if you want the best of the best, but it is the same in ANY MMO out there, it's the whole point of giving you something to keep doing and goals to achieve. One of my favorite things is the rewards for completing quests. You actually get skills for completing quests. This to me helps get rid of the desire to ""grind"" for levels. As in WOW, it is actually quicker to just ""farm"" or ""grind"" in a specific area for experience to level than to do the quests. All you get from the quests in WOW is weapons , armor, or items that are most likely (%90 of the time) worse than what you already have. Also with GW it is nice not knowing when or where you will actually be getting your next skill from. I know that sounds wierd, but in WOW you get ""new"" skills (""new"" is usualy just upgrades for the skills you already have, you will have %60 of all the skills you will ever learn by lvl 20, %80 by lvl 30, and %95 by lvl 40) every ""even"" level. And it could take a good 3 hrs to get to the next level, if all you do is grind. So you play for about 6 hrs killing the same thing over and over again to get small upgrades. And you keep doing it cause you know you have to to get that new item, armor, skill, etc. With GW since you don't have that whole level crunching to get what you want thing, you are enticed to explore the world. -And the world is nicely detailed. It could use a little more fleshing out, but over all it is nice. It really is no different than any other MMORPG. The land is vast with small pockets of towns, and is sparsely populated with NPCs. The same with WOW. But what is nice with GW is that once you get to a main town/outpost, you can teleport thier instantly. In WOW you might spend 20 mins just flying/running to get to where you need to be, and that is only once you hit lvl 40 and buy a mount (wich is no small feat or small amount of cash). With WOW before you are lvl 40 you could easily spend 30 - 60 mins. Depending on whether or not you have gotten the right ""Flight Paths"" to get to where you need to be. -The Quest sytem is nice in GW. It's easy to understand, and you get a friggin green arrow that tells you where you should be going next, what instance to go into, and where on the map you need to be. In WOW, good luck, you will probably be looking it up in an Online Database, or asking around. Wich is not such a big deal, but you will be amazed at how much more time is spent actually playing instead of runing around looking for stuff, and how more efficient you can plan your questing adventures. A few mins spent in GW you can see how many quests are in a certain area and plan to do those so that you can kill more birds with one stone. Thank you for that Anet. -Once you get to the lvl Cap and have gotten all your skills (there are ""elite"" skills which you can only get by learning them from enemies) you can do the PvP portions of the game, wich are fast paced and action packed. I've read a lot of things about how hard it is to compete in PvP because you can't find a good group of people to play with. Well it's the same in ANY online game RPG or FPS or RTS. It takes some time to find good people to play with, but once you do it can be a lot of fun. At least in GW you have the options to join a PvP game by yourself, or with a group you're with, or do guild vs guild. And the system matches you up with like experienced/leveled/Rank people. You can kind of do the same thing in WOW, with the battle grounds addition (wich was just added about mid year 2005), but the long que waits (about 20 - 45mins depending on server population) might be kind of tedious for you. Especially if your lvl 60 with not a whole lot to do otherwise. And with GW if you don't want to do the questing part of the game you don't have to. You can imediatley create a PvP only character. Your PvP only character will not have all the perks of a character that got to lvl 20 by questing, but you can still have a lot of fun, you just won't be the best of the best. At least you have the option. -As far as GW not being considered a MMO: GW in my opinion is more MMO than any other MMORPG. With WOW you pick a specific server to build your characters on. You can have many characters on several different servers, but if they are on different servers you can't play with people on other servers. Wich might not be a big deal, but if you find you like the people better on a certain server or want to play on the RPG servers or PvP servers, you have to be lucky enough for them to offer transfers from your server to those servers. Wich they don't seem to do until a specific server is being over populated. Where as with GW you are automatically logged on to a specific ""district"" and at your whim you can change districts. Even internationally. This way ANYONE that plays GW can hook up with ANYONE else that is on at the time. That to me is closer to ""Massively Multiplayer"" than the server specific variety of MMO's. -In relation to the whole MMO thing. Everything outside the main towns/outposts is instanced for every specific group. I love this. As in all MMORPG's there is a lot of quests that require you to spend time traveling in the unknown wilderness to get something, kill something, etc. Few things are more bothersome than going to do such a quest and finding several like powered individuals doing the exact same thing. I thought I was supposed to be unique, I thought my quest was uniqe. WOW fails misrabley here. You will always be on the same quest as someone else, if not many people. You might even have to wait around while the enemy critter(s) respawn, or even fight with someone else over who gets to kill what, or just get ganked. This is not an epic experience to me. So what if I'm a powerfull ""Hero"" there are going to be thousands of the exact same type of hero out there with you. The ""World"" of Warcraft is populated more by ""heroes"" than normal peole. In GW it may be the case as well, but at least you don't have to see them all the time. -There is not a lot of emphisis on item collection for other than profit/sales. This I know a lot of people dislike, but in my opinion it adds to the gameplay. Instead an endless struggle to get a new axe with a +2 to strength instead of a +1, it doesn't really matter in GW. You will be just as effective, and they are there for the item needy person, but the game doesn't revolve around it. It's all WOW is about really, getting a better version of what you had before. -The skill system is really nice in GW. You only get to take 8 skills into battle. Wich can be frustrating at times, where you wish you would have taken another skill instead, but over all it forces you to be specific on what type of character you are playing. Wich is also nice because there are more than one use/roll for your character now. The duel class system is cool, you get to choose from two sets of skills, but only the first class you choose lets you alter thier main attribute, wich does make a difference in you character. And the abillity to change you attributes at will is very nice. Now you can only change skills/spells and attributes in main towns/outposts, but the frustation is minimal for the freedom to tailor your character so many ways. -The rank system for new items is nice to me. It gives the long term player something to shoot for. And it is no better or worse than WOW in my opinion, both are a pain for the casual gamer and a pain for the consitent gamer. It rewards time spent gaming. Same with WOW. -I really like the story of GW. It could be a little deeper, but it's nice. I also like you the land changes with the story. Right now there is only the two settings, or time periods, but at least I felt that I went a long with a change in time for the game. I also like how the main characters of the story are also interactive with most of the main quests. When you are called to help the prince with pushing back the enemy, he is there with you fighting along side. Also seen in many of the ""side"" quests with the everyday folk. Or when you complete a quest that called you to kill a Leader or find a group and lead them back, if you go back to the same spots later the people or leader are gone. Giving you a sense of actual accomplishment. Good luck in WOW to see any of this in WOW. Very few NPC characters actually physically come along with you, and if they do then that means someone else can't interact with them, and vise versa for you. Not one time in my whole WOW career did I ever see any piece of land change or NPC character good or bad change, wether or not I completed a specific quest 10 times. How epic is that. The biggest reason for this is because there isn't a whole lot to do than the same thing over and over again in WOW, that's why so many people have logged in so many hours in WOW. They took half a game, spread it out over twice as many levels as they should have, and charged people for it. Wich leads into my biggest rant. -GW is free to play online. They update it regularly, with new content as well as fixes. WOW charges you $13 - $15 per month to play (depending on whether you pay monthy or in 6 month blocks, both reacuring automatically), wether you play at all or all day everyday. And that's not the worst part. WOW was released before it was complete. So you payed $50 for half a game, I already said that I know, but one of the biggest reasons Blizzard said the cost was so high per month was because they would be updating it constantly for free. Well guess what, a year later they are finally to the point the game should have been when it was released. This is not an opinion. You can't honestly tell me that such big things like the PvP ranking/honor sytem was something they just came up with, or the battle grounds addition. These where things they had planned that just didn't get in to the release. And there is more updates comming. Now for some numbers. 5 million people have active accounts on WOW, most are paying accounts, some are trial accounts. Lets go back a bit and cut the number in have just to be conservative. Lets say 2 million people have been playing and only half of those were paying customers, and lets say they all payed in 6 month blocks at $13 a month. 1 million times $13 a month = 13 million dollars a MONTH, with equals 156 million dollars a year. If that isn't absurd to you then you have a bigger problem than what video game to play. There is no way that it cost that much to keep WOW servers running or fix bugs. And that number is not including the original profit from the sales of the game, (remember each paying active account also bought the game) or the profit from the merchandise they sell, and there is a whole lot of merchandise to buy and or being bought. So with all that cash they are just finishing a game and guess what, they are going to charge you another $20 - $50 to buy the expansion 1st quarter 2006. This is the main reason I quit WOW, I can not support such a greedy company for a product that is lower in quality than one that is of higher quality from a company that does just as much if not more for thier game. -On some less positive notes for GW: Jumping would be nice. I know it doesn't really do anything for you and would mess up the PvP arenas (they could disable it there) it is just nice to jump, small con in my opinion. A little more content on the RPG side of the game would be nice. More scripted quests with NPC's would be nice. Over all just small cons that could be or will be changed/fixed with updates and expansions. All in all this is a very good game and has shown it is impoving. It is the best MMORPG out there in my opinion, but that doesn't mean it will satisfy everyone out there. And another game is sure to come alone to take your time elsewhere. At least with GW when the time comes for that other game you will still have some cash in your pocket :)",JesseM.

So if you enjoy fighters I strongly suggest you go out and buy Guilty Gear XX, also when I bought it new the day it came out the price was at a surprising 45 dollars, and a used version should be much lower.

Another quick fault they felt was once every while your hand/arm would cramp up really badly (but it's a wii game, it happens sadly.) However there is much more good then bad. The game play has been smoothed out, and camera has been changed to an extend to improve it. Another positive is there is 3 characters that you can play as, and one can actually jump. Aside from that, graphics have improved and the increase in boss fights was a nice touch as well (or perhaps a nice touchdown.)

With interesting gameplay, magnificent graphics and a brilliant story I have to say, Horizon Zero Dawn is amazing achievement in gaming. One of the the best titles for PS4 ever.After 150 hours in-game, HZD deserves few comments extra. I'm not that kind of player who collects trophies but in this game I went platinum. And one other thing, I think this was the only game that I completed 100%. The thing is, in most of the games, there is no need to accomplish this. In HZD, it was actually really fun to do so. Key word is fun: exploring world, fighting tough machines like Stormbirds, Rockbreakers or Thunderjaws, finding stuff like shield-weaver armor or terblaster weapon, completing strange quests like ""Acquired taste"" and so on. I'm really sad because there is no more than 22 side quests and this world crave for more especially in the end,  when you finish the game. Few words about weapon and outfit system. Outfits are nice balanced. You are not limited with only one armor and modification, you can use the best one depending on situation and you can exchange modifications as you like. Weapons and armor alike. As for weapons, my favorite is  Tripcaster and variety of traps it provides. Did you know, you can kill any machine instantly with it?  And corruption arrows? You don't need to override the machines to make them fight for you. Just use Corruption arrows! As I said, this is a fun part so please ignore those zero score reviews they're not real.

It's a fairly lengthy campaign with a decent plot and fun missions. Of course, though, the main core of the game play lies on the multi-player, which I think is personally a bit more flawed compared to the single player campaign. Having the map packs actually helps a lot, as it adds a HUGE variety of maps (30+ IIRC) into the online multi-player. Most of these maps are straightforward, unfortunately, and they tend to be fairly campy, which easily allows people the abuse these particular spots. The motion sensor equipment doesn't really help either, which is basically a mini-UAV radar. Yes,  I think Black Ops multi-player is mostly unbalanced. A lot of people say it's more balanced than MW2, but I'm just not seeing the difference.One thing that really makes up for multi-player though is the zombies game type. Having the map packs also helps with this, as those maps are actually very fun and entertaining to play. I just wish they could have added just as much effort to the multi-player's balance though.

The smoothness of movement was really great, you really didn't jump where you didn't want to, which is much better than as example in Prince of Persia:  Forgotten Sands. You also have to give credit to the player involvement in cut scenes/dialogue, the player was rarely cut off from the game watching a cut scene, instead what they added was a ""memory error"" a little interactive camera angle switch which kept the player aware. The only place where i felt the player was stripped of his control was finishers, i would have loved to actually get to press each move myself and not watch my guy just roll a certain animation in a canned film manner.Overall, AC was a entertaining package with its repetitiveness and solid game play.",ihQprinsessa

If you cannot appreciate meticulous detail, subtle hints, painstakingly hidden environmental details, or are not inclined to perfectionism, this game is not for you. Many reviews I've read apparently have a hatred for puzzles, which is 95% of what this game isAfter seeing only negative reviews on the front page for this game, I felt I needed to chime in.This is a thinking man's game. If you cannot appreciate meticulous detail, subtle hints, painstakingly hidden environmental details, or are not inclined to perfectionism, this game is not for you. Many reviews I've read apparently have a hatred for puzzles, which is 95% of what this game is about. If you are easily frustrated and despise the idea of learning interesting new mechanics, well, why did you think paying $40 for this game was a good idea?If you require instant gratification, this isn't the best use of your time and money.However, if you're like me, and have a deep appreciation for brain-benders and don't mind being stumped on a dozen different puzzles at once, you need to get this game. There is a perplexing draw to the whole experience - the promise of an overarching puzzle within a puzzle within all of the other puzzles you're solving. It's not just about navigating several hundred mazes. It's about what you learn, what you feel, how you think, and the way you process the sights and sounds of this precisely engineered world. There are times where you will break the fourth wall for yourself and think, ""How did they program that?"" yet remain in awe of the task you've just completed.That's really what I appreciate about this game. I haven't felt this satisfied with a gaming experience since the original Dark Souls. I'm reminded heavily of that game's brutal difficulty when going into it as a brand new experience. This game draws multiple parallels despite being a wholly different genre. In Dark Souls, after defeating a notoriously difficult boss after numerous attempts, the feeling of victory is nearly unrivaled - that is, until you play The Witness, and solve a series of puzzles over the course of an hour that leave you feeling like a genius. It will require plenty of intuiting, and the occasional figurative slamming of your head against a wall, but nothing in this game requires brute force. It is all learned, it all builds upon itself, and it all, majestically, simply, cohesively... works.Some of the later puzzles will really test your ability to navigate intimidating labyrinths as you plot every scrupulous step. I was stubborn in my tackling of such puzzles, as I never wrote anything down or made diagrams until much later. Side note, I would recommend writing things down and making some diagrams. Maybe take a picture of your screen. Or don't, like me!It doesn't hurt that I'm playing on a 55"" 4K TV with a 980 Ti. The attention to detail, regardless of the painterly overtones, is not lost on me. While plain from a distance, up close is where the magic truly shines. The color grading and art direction going from different zones of the island are incredible, evoking a totally different feel within seconds of traversal. Were I not to enjoy the puzzles, this game would still be a joy of a sight to behold.This game is this generation's Myst, no doubt about it. Playing this felt like I was touring Jonathan Blow's synapses, and getting a glimpse at how beautiful the human mind can be. Without flattering the developer too much, I think of this game as a genuine gift to gamers worldwide, and its fastidious creation over the last 7 years or so is without a doubt a labor of love.So, I have a lot of high praise for this game, but it's not quite perfect. If I were to complain about anything, it would be the lack of exposition, and the really-quite-terrible audio logs: Strewn and hidden about the world are different tiny recorders you can activate, and each one is narrated by a person reading a quote by someone who sounds really full of themselves, and loves hearing themselves speak about things that sound smart but are in fact common knowledge. There are quotes from religious authors, astronauts, Albert Einstein... and they're all grating, and frankly, weird. After I time I stopped activating the logs because they were intrusive and annoying to my experience. I actually hate this aspect of this game, but thankfully it's optional. I didn't find my first one until about an hour or two in, so it was a cool surprise, which rapidly devolved once I realized how utterly lame they were. I'm sure they thought this was a good idea, but in practice, I thought it was pretty awful.There hasn't been a single puzzle I haven't enjoyed solving (except for the really easy ones which are not challenging). I don't think you can ask much more of a game that entirely revolves around such, but the developers really did go above and beyond, and made the otherwise mundane into a masterpiece. Bravo.9.5/10, but giving it a 10 on Metacritic to balance out the feeble-minded simpletons who lack the intellect to appreciate ingenuity, or otherwise dislike Jonathan Blow for being smart and successful.",DarthPadme

This game is antiquated, using assets from other games, animations from Skyrim, and its bugginess through and through is a testament of how much they need to scrap everything they're working with and start over from scratch.  I'm reviewing the PC version, but the consoles are even worse - both locked at 30 FPS with frequent dips into the teens, or worse, seconds-long hang ups and load times that seem to go on forever.  At least I'm getting 60+ FPS at all times on 1440p, maxed out, with ""minimal"" load times.Since I'm stuck with this game now, I did try to play it further, and holy crap, what a weird experience.  The characters have zero, well, character! The voice acting is full of pizazz, and the NPCs just stand there, lifeless by comparison, as their game models barely try to approximate facial expressions, let alone matching the words with their mouths.  This game makes L.A. Noire's face tech look like it's from the **** future.  This game makes Witcher 3's dialogue cutscenes look better than real life.  And speaking of dialogue, I hope you don't like knowing exactly what you're going to say, as Bethesda has dumbed down another critical RPG feature and replaced it with vague choices that DO NOT correspond to what your character will say.All in all, from the game's combat, to its busywork, to the graphics and mechanics, Fallout 4 is a COLOSSAL disappointment.  If you feel you must play this game, pirate it, because Bethesda and its full staff of developers do not deserve to be rewarded for this ****  The media is eating this up just like they did with Skyrim, and dare I say it, this game is even more overhyped.

The multiplayer on this game is AWESOME. No crappy matchmaking like COD, dedicated servers, vehicles, huge maps, servers up to 64 players, vehicles etc. There are a few drawbacks for me. As a long time COD player, I am use to very fluid motions in game, very fast reloads, fast stance changing etc. The body mechanics in this game are SO stiff and rigid. One thing I have never understood about games is when the mechanics are different in single player than multiplayer. In single player you can go from prone to crouch, crouch to standing, or any variation without ever breaking your aim (aim down sight) and go from prone to sprint very quickly but in the multiplayer if you're prone you break your aim and slowly prop yourself up then have to re-aim again. Reloading (especially anti-air and anti-tank missiles feels like it takes hours). Though these aren't vital to games success it is hard to get use to. With all of my criticisms out of the way this game is FANTASTIC. If you have friends who play this game you can all squad up, and coordinate attacks, objectives etc. and it actually brings teamwork to multiplayer (something COD REALLLY lacks). I started off not liking the stiffness of this game but as I've played longer and longer it is CLEARLY the choice over Modern Warfare 3. This game was designed with the PC player in mind. I've played on the xbox 360 and PC and the graphics on PC make xbox graphics look like a 5 year old's hand drawing. It's refreshing to see a game that had hard work, dedication, and passion involved in it's development and not some recycled garbage from past years.

There was something truly interesting about Advance wars days of ruin that stuck with me long after I put down my D.S and that was how much they explore in the game. There is a lot of depth to be explored in this game and while many players might enjoy the more cute and colorful experience of this game's predecessor there was so much about this game that truly caused players to explore the darker side of war. Players get to explore topics like post-apocalyptic worlds, unregulated science, charismatic megalomaniacs,  how individuals select role-models, the dark side of being a soldier, fear, hope, mercenaries, governments, etc. all wrapped up in a turned based platform long-time fans of the series will love and is quick to learn for new players.In terms of game play there is a significant decrease in the number of commanders you get to choose  from in multi-player mode, each commander holds little advantage over other commanders and Co-powers are less dominant in this game then in other games that share the advance war title. However, there is a major benefit to this new design and that how the playing field is leveled, which means players need to better major their resources in order to achieve a strategic advantage in battle against friends and AI enemies.",LumpyPotato23

The Good: Ni No Kuni is probably one of the most visually appealing games that I have played in a long time and I salute the developers for how they blended the story, music and visuals together to create beautiful synergy that is appealing to players. In addition, the story, while lacking some character development, is solid and constant with elements that compels you to continue playing. It is easy to lose hours of daylight playing Ni No Kuni so I recommend you keep a schedule just so you remember to eat. Ni No Kuni plays out a lot like a movie and I am glad they were able to incorporate some movie like aspects to this game because like most RPGs the story is what drives the game. On an individual level, battle is engaging because of the variety of options you have to command. You can use your main character who will specialize in particular skills or use your familiars for more specialized stats that better serve the battle field. There are a lot of side quests, exploration and a variety of different things that can consume your time in Ni No Kuni, which gives this all ready long game even more content for the player to enjoy. The Bad: Ni No Kuni defines for players what it truly means to grind. Normally grinding is not a thing that would bother me, but in Ni No Kuni compared to other RPGs makes grinding mandatory. This is because the battle difficultly grows exponentially whenever you travel to a new section and if your characters are under leveled then be prepared to get beat more than a punching bag. Thanks to this grinding it slows down the pace of the game and I safety compare the pacing of this game to being on a glacier moving aimlessly through the ocean. This means that it is possible to invest hours of game play and get only one suspenseful  and/or engaging moment in the storyline. What makes matters worse is the AI lacks basic survival skills due to their nasty habit of charging the enemies only to get stomped to death. This is particularly troublesome during boss fights, which at times comes down to Oliver and the over-powered, over-sized baddie. While the game will give you basic commands like All-Out Attack and All-Out Defense the tactics involved in battle don't go deeper than that, but it will help you keep your AI allies alive longer. Perhaps the lack of tactics was a game mechanic choice to show the inexperience of Oliver's leadership capabilities, but I certainly wouldn't complain if they made the AI commands more specific. You could try micro-managing, but that will get frustrating quickly.",LumpyPotato23

The good news is with so much variety, a player can craft the perfect story that provides the best game play experience.Assassins Creed 3 is a fun game. The game is not afraid to explore the darker side of the American Revolution. There is a lot to do in the adventure sandbox world of Assassins Creed 3 because the sandbox is littered with thousands of mini-games like hunting game, liberating areas from Templar control, securing trade routes, searching for treasure, etc., etc. The game also includes a new feature that adds an additional dimension of gameplay. This new feature is captaining your own frigate battleship. This additional gameplay mechanic allows players the ability to engage in naval battles against the British red coats. However, given all these options, there is a certain amount of monotony that accompanies these mini-games. The only real reward is money or the ability to make more money. Perhaps a better incentive would be unlocking new missions and content after mastering a mini-game. Until then I am going to avoid the activities that I find tedious. A part of me feels that the developers of Assassins Creed are ashamed of the game’s core mechanics, which are the assassinations of high profile target. So they make numerous mini-games to appease their unwarranted feelings of embarrassment. Don’t be embarrassed Assassins Creed; the assassinations are the best part and at least the story is compelling. In Assassin Creed 3 we get to explore colonial America through the lens of Connor who is the protagonist of this game. For what it is worth Connor is an amazingly compelling character because of his development throughout the game, but I couldn't help but hate him to for all the whining that he does. In addition there are so many moments where Connor fights with the idea of being an assassin and even believes he doesn't need to kill Templars to accomplish his objective. He will soon find that showing mercy is a terrible trait to have for an assassin.",LumpyPotato23

Skyrim is no exception in this sense, the world is massive and sprawling, with a ton of interesting quests and characters to meet, as well as multiple dungeons littered with their own unique stories and background. For mePersonally, I love this game alot, and pretty much adore most sandbox games that reward inquisitive minds, exploration, and a love of rich lore and plentiful characters. Skyrim is no exception in this sense, the world is massive and sprawling, with a ton of interesting quests and characters to meet, as well as multiple dungeons littered with their own unique stories and background. For me personally, I love the fact that the world really feels alive, every NPC has their own schedules, mountains you can scale jut into the sky in the distance, the cry of dragons rolls through the hils from a distance before you see one circling overhead, and it gives the impression of an epic world which will continue to live and breathe even when you put down the controller. However, this is what I love about the game, and in all honesty, I have to confess many things which might deter some people and downright put off other gamers. Alot of the dungeons use recycled assets, as well as many houses, and if there is one way to describe a flaw of Skyrim it is 'repetition', both in terms of NPCs generated over and over 'hence the infamous 'arrow to the knee' to every other tavern looking basically the same. Some people say that Skyrim is 'as vast as an ocean and as shallow as a pond', but I think that's only half true. They're right in that many quests in Skyrim are downright boring, if not insulting to the average gamer's intelligence. 'Oh hai there Dragonborn. You're here to slay the World Eater? Well could you also deliver my axe to my cousin across the hold? There's a good boy! 'Oh hey stranger, mind checking my catacombs for generic skeleton warriors to retrieve my 'insert levelled loot here'? The five dozen guards outside can't be bothered.' These quests are beyond terrible, and many dungeons have been designed as cookie cutter areas to ensure the same NPCs send you to the same places over and over and over to retrieve vague, non-specfied loot. If you judged Skyrim on this alone, you would not be faulted for throwing it outside the nearest window. However, for me, I think gamers who only see this don't recognise the true flaws and beauty of what an open world like Skyrim means. Skyrim is a buffet of gameplay and quests. Some of the quests taste like filet mignon, they are interesting, the gameplay choices available are though provoking, and the characters are well detailed and engaging. Other parts of the buffet though are like bland, stale mashed potatoes, a mushy mess of bad gameplay decisions, poor gamer choice and uninspired dialogue and stories. This is the nature of the beast though, Skyrim is massive enough that in some parts it will inevitably miss for some people, but in others, so many parts connect so well, that it just makes you absorbs you for days on end(even without mods, and having played with mods on my PC, and without them on Xbox, I still feel Skyrim vanilla is a great game in its own right). As for the bugs though, although I gave Skyrim a pass because I loved the concept behind it of a massive world filled with possibilities, there is no doubt this game is packed full of glitches and bugs(though in my experience, not as many crashes as Oblivion). I love what Bethesda try to do, but seriously, when Red Dead Redemption provides a game of that size and complexity without many bugs, it really makes you wonder when Bethesda will jettison its crappy Gamebryo engine for something that doesn't suck. If you love interesting concepts and expansive, immersive sandboxes, buy Skyrim. If you prefer tighter, more focused RPGs buy the Witcher 2. In my opinion though having played and finished both, my love of one does not diminish my love for the other, and as long as Bethesda and  CD Projekt RED continue to develop games, the RPG genre has a rich and exciting future ahead of us.",MinosOfCrete

What really leaps out though is the brilliant 'agility' mechanics which allows you to scale buildings and jump from rooftop to rooftop like Spiderman on steroids. The melee mechanics aren't anything to write home about, with connection poor and flimsy, but this is easily compensated for by the ability to pick almost every part of the environment up and hurl it at enemies, starting from bricks and cardoors all the way to trucks and 'Universal Studios' sized globes as you increase in your skills. The driving as well is slightly flawed in the sense that every car apart from about three are terrible to drive, even when you improve your driving skills, and have no true distinguishing features, although the ability of your 'Agency' vehicles to transform as your skill improves is not only impressive, but have great and entertaining abilities as well.In the end, buy this if you love the freedom and gritty world of GTA mixed with the sense of justice and superhero flair of Batman Arkham City.

Assassin creed 2 is a very good game and well it certainly was a lot better than AC1 it still has a ton of problems to sort out. The story for one was very underwhelming both with the dialogue and the sequences shown. The revenge mission is a nice premise but it was a bit underwhelming in feel. The free running while simple to use sometimes backfire in a bad way. I never died and hardly got hit while fighting but died a half dozen times because of a jump that was not done correctly by the game. The combat can be impressive at times but usually you will rely on a few moves like counter and disarm was my main attacks as they dispatched foes fastest. There are more options but not very useful in the situations you are put in. the graphics on the game are alright I played on it for 1 week and completed it excellent game for anyone who likes loads of action AC1 as i said it got it problems but over all that it a brilliant game like AC2.

157181,Max Payne 3,PC,5,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        An alternative name for this game would be ""Linear Tales of a Frantic Headshooter"". I've never played a more linear and stereotype game. Basically you only watch cutscenes and headshot enemies. Even the shooting and gameplay gets old quite fast. I was also extremely sick of the depressed over-emotional superhuman that Max Payne had become. No deep and meaningful thoughts or revenge to follow. Zero atmosphere, zero detective, zero immersion, only 24/7 whining over everything that happens in the game. Plus it's a brand new world, I was hoping that this game would bring up my memories from old Max Payne. Michelle, dark noir, flashbacks, the feels, the nightmares, the junkies, the story, snowing in the night. Nope, none of it. If you changed Max Payne object for some John Smith and changed 0.1% of the game, you would not even recognize it has to do something with Max Payne world.Also, I don't think the creators have played this game. After every cutscene Max switches from his whatever currently equipped to a simple beretta. Every time. Whatever you are holding, even it was the HUMAN DESTROYER MACHINE GUN 9001. And it is not even easy to switch back to the gun you held, sometimes you accidentally drop it during the switching. Not to mention many, many, many details and imperfections and annoying mechanics in this game, seriously ffs.I must say I wanted to recommend this game. For a long time I really wanted, I tried very hard. The only thing that wanted me to recommend were level design and music. Hell those things gave me genuine shivers. I got many ""whoa omg wow much epic"" moments because of it. It is the only reason why you should play it and trust me you will be stunned. However everything else perfectly balances out this epicness and I'm afraid in the end you are not going to be that pleased.",TheLagbringer

Geralt of Rivia, the smoothest badass ever created.My friends recommended me this game. I was struggling a lot in the beginning as well as everyone who played The Witcher. I hated this game and at times came very close to uninstalling it. But I always thought ""they said its good, there must be more to it"" and kept playing. Indeed, after 3-5 hours into the game I understood. Behind a complicated story, totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ talents and combat mechanics there lies one of the best RPG games I've ever played. After you grip the overall gameplay it will stop to irritate you and patterns will start to display. You will be able to enjoy the rich and immersive story, full of intrigues and twists and also those weird combats. The story is the strongest part of the game, it is very mature where decisions are hard with serious consequences and are never good or evil. They just define your political and personal preferences as you progress from an outcast monster killer. The game is also very long. I like to fulfill every quest, check all chests and barrels and enjoy games in general. With such approach, The Witcher took me 65 hours to finish. Every second was definitely worth it. Do yourself a favor, buy the game and play it. Don't get demotivated by prologue and the first act, keep playing and eventually you will get consumed, I guarantee you that. Last time this happened to me was when I played Fallout 2 few years ago, this game quite reminded me of it and I thank its creators for that.",TheLagbringer

As a result, the game is not a huge emo blob, but rather a very enjoyable adventure.

Death is an assertive badass that knows what he wants and goes for it. In fact, all characters combined with the game's epic narration, occasional hand drawn comics, and voice acting were incredible and spot on. Not to mention the different realms you traverse on your ultimate quest and the matching atmospheric music that comes with them. I enjoyed the design with much delight.Fight system is somewhat standard for this genre. Fast pace, no aiming required, just precise timing and dodging and knowledge of few combos. Sometimes adjusting camera during the fight (which took some time to get used to, but nothing crucial to worry about). I only felt like once I settled to my optimal combos and attack moves I used them everywhere with unmatched opposition and it got a bit repetitive. The biggest boss fights usually brought new fight patterns, but apart from that were still the same. Skill system and weapons (including the secrets/boss loot) offered only a little variety in them with little feeling of reward.Though I still strongly recommend this game, just because the design part was extremely well done.

I purchased the $40 GOTY edition, where in the past, most GOTY editions come with everything that's come out for a game... and would think almost 5 years later, they'd be more than happy to have everything bundled together for the $40 I paid. But no... and don't get me wrong, I'm happy with the 10 items that are included in Steam's GOTY edition... but then while I'm in game, I go over to the customization-station, and see at least 5 skins for the Gunzerker that have an ""*"" next to them and figured maybe that meant they were premium items that were included... go to equip one, to find out I have to pay $1 each for each of the 5 or so ""*"" skins, and while perusing, notice there's about 5 for each class. So 6 classes x 5 skins @ $1 a piece, that'd be another $30 right there for JUST SKINS. Then while perusing father, it dawns on me that the Season Pass also wasn't part of the package, which is another $30... then I see scenario packs (but from what I understand they'd be included with the Season Pass, so won't list their prices), but on top of that, there's other packs, like a second level-cap pack (GOTY included the first I believe), which is another $5.Get where I'm going here!? $40 for GOY edition, plus $30 for JUST SKINS, plus $30 for Season Pass, plus $5 for the second level-cap pack (fairly certain that covers everything, but considering the lengthy list of DLC on Steam for this can't be certain)... so just to have the COMPLETE Borderlands 2 experience, even almost 5 years later, WITH a newer Borderlands (Pre-Sequal) that has released, looking at spending $105 at least!!! There's a ""Borderlands: Take Over Your Life"" pack for $129 which I believe included all Borderlands games, and I'd assume by the name everything for them... just WOW!To be fair, I can at least recommend Borderlands 2 and perhaps even the GOTY edition, so long as you're going to just play the game and do your best to dodge all pay-walls and invisible dollar signs looming through the game... but I must say, so early on in the game to be struck in the face with, ""oh, that'll cost you this much extra"" after already having purchased the GOTY edition almost 5 years later on after the original release... I sadly am left with a ""Need For Speed: Most Wanted"" (the remake) impression... where immersion feels now a bit constantly broken, and honestly a bit gross, with pay-walls and missing-content and invisible dollar-signs looming all throughout the game. >_<(From what I read about what's in the scenarios and the second level-cap pack, and skins, and other stuff... really feel like even after paying $40 almost 5 years later, there's still a decent amount that I'm missing out on. Honestly, I could easily afford the other $65 or more DLC, but the principle is just slapping me in the face like a stinky tuna-fish!)",ZombieTech

I don't care if this is a standard for Japanese RPGs, this game is very low in terms of quality, and quite frankly, sh*t. This game should be a free to play more than anything.",Knightmare725

I like the up in difficulty, I really do. Its allows for dedication and immersion. But the game is flat out relentless and will make most regular 2k fans feel like theyre playing Dark Souls at first and will leave every game feeling like a glorified bum with all of the characters praising you like a blind kid after hes allowed to score a touchdown. Then theres the VC offering to cheer you up like a wizard granting you powers to fight the evil dragon. Then theres the long cutscenes that you cant skip that leave you no choice to just observe the stupidity of the cutscenes and ask yourself questions like ""Why is there a random downy escaped from Pyongyang in my appartment, Why does my character act like hes black and why are the black dudes okay with it? How did i get picked up by the NBA because of a street ball game?"" A big problem with the MyCarrer is that players dont know what theyre in for and will probably end up restarting and will have to endure the painful intro sequence over again. This game has its positives though, such as the character customization and how the white faces dont look like cave trolls anymore. The challenge increase of the difficulty. And the hub area being a fun and immersive addition. Overall, this game would be pretty decent if it werent for the microtransactions.",Knightmare725

I imagine I'll attend some competitive events as a spectator if the Smash eSports scene takes off again with this iteration, but overall my interest is essentially casual while writingI come from a casual Smashing background with no experience in the real competitive scene. To me it's a party game with a learning curve that can keep you amused and bettering yourself for hours upon hours. I imagine I'll attend some competitive events as a spectator if the Smash eSports scene takes off again with this iteration, but overall my interest is essentially casual while writing this review.That said, this is a fantastic new addition to the series. We had a ""Smash Bash"" party the day after release and had an absolute blast. Smash 4 is still a phenomenal party game and with the 8 player Smash you can involve just about everyone who's interested in playing simultaneously at modest gatherings.Almost everything about this game is stellar, so let me just list my minor gripes:- Smash Tour is somewhat dull- There is no Smash Run like 3DS Smash on the Wii-U, only the aforementioned Tour- Acquiring duplicate moves, trophies and customization items can be frustrating- Sometimes the controllers get glitchy when you're using GameCube and/or Pro Controllers- My friends are better than meSo Smash Tour is a board game adaptation of Smash Run. It's much less engaging in my opinion. In fact, it honestly just about puts me to sleep. Going between monotonous board movement and playing matches with characters you don't choose just isn't all that enjoyable to me. I really wish they would have just kept Smash Run on the Wii-U just like 3DS instead of this mode.As for the controller issue I mentioned, we had particular trouble with the GameCube controller adapter, but it was easily rectified by unplugging the GameCube controller and plugging it back in. Sometimes our Pro controllers would send inputs without us touching them as well, forcing us to reboot the entire system to resolve. Overall though, we may have spent a total of 15-20 minutes fighting buggy controllers during a 10 hour Smash session, much of which had 7-8 players going... so it's really not that bad.Those negative points aside, this game is nearly perfect.The interface is fluid and beautiful. The game's graphics are simply astounding. I think I've only noticed one shadow in the Orbital Assault stage that I didn't like. There was a bit of feathered dithering going on that catches my eye. Otherwise the texturing, shading and lighting of the game looks so great it's unbelievable. It's about the most ""realistic"" cartoony graphics experience I've ever seen.Gameplay is very smooth. In the 30+ hours I've put in so far I think I've noticed two instances of framerate drops... and it could have even been my imagination. I can't believe how smoothly things run in 8-man Smash. I was entirely anticipating a bit of a stuttery situation when things got heavy, but saw nothing of the sort.I love what they've done with the game's mechanics too. Movesets feel mostly balanced and there have been improvements that I feel add to the competitive potential of the game. The Equipment customization is a neat system that adds to my enjoyment. When I don't feel like improving my game, I can still lazily farm better equipment, which has its own form of amusement and a feeling of progression.There's so much content in this release and [almost] all of it has immense value to provide. Even the Angry Birds ripoff iteration of Target Smash can be fun and challenging. Events are great, the Co-Op/Competitive opportunities are prolific, and every mode aside from Smash Tour is super fun and well polished.I have to give this title a 10. Even though I had negative points to express, there's just no way it's deserving of a score so low as 9. If I didn't already have a Wii-U for Bayonetta 2 and Hyrule Warriors, this game would have easily pushed me to pick one up.

Unlike some, I didn't have a problem with the controls and the graphics were lovely. My biggest issue was with the world and the narrative. The game borrows from Elder Scrolls in that it has very large environments, however unlike in the Elder Scrolls series, the environments are barren and uninteresting. The AI is also not very good.The game assumes you're going to be playing as a human or an elf and if you're not then you're going to run into some serious problems during cutscenes. If you're playing as a qunari or a dwarf, expect your characters head to not be visible during some cutscenes as the camera won't adjust itself for your height. The character creation isn't particularly my cup of tea either. For someone reason Bioware spent all their time and effort allowing you to change the size of your adams apple instead of giving players more varied hair styles. The hair cuts are the same regardless of race or gender, with the exception of qunari. Qunari players will only get about 5 or 6 near identical hair styles to choose from. In addition the armor for the player character looks the same regardless of race or class. There are some exclusive armors for race but not many. As for crafting, it's not particularly good but it could be worse.For a role playing perspective, the game doesn't offer very many diverse dialogue options. I remember before the game came out the developers were saying you could play as a tyrant-you really can't. For players like myself who enjoy role playing evil characters there's not really many options. In addition, Bioware blatantly ignores many of the players choices for previous games to make a world closer to what THEY want rather than what the player wants. For instance, a major character from Origins can potentially be killed off in that game. No matter what the players decision that character will be alive and well in Inquisition. There will be a slight mention of their ""death"" in the game but it barely plays into their character, and this just one of many instances of this sort of thing happening in Inquisition.  I honestly wouldn't have a problem with this if Bioware wasn't claiming to make choice based RPG's, because they're really not. This is easily one of their most linear products.Probably the biggest issue I have with the game is the narrative. So much of the story takes place on this awfully implemented feature call ""the war table"" which is straight up filler used to extend the game. To make matters worse, the game has quite possibly the weakest conclusion I've ever seen in a game. It shamelessly ends on what is basically a trailer for DLC.Long story short, while not the worst game I've ever played this was easily one of the most disappointing and the last time I'll buy one of Bioware's products.",liquideyeliner

This game wants to be a RTS that emphasizes tactics and strategy, but ends up being more of a cleverly disguised spinoff of the Command & Conquer series than anything else. Don't get me wrong there are lots of cool ideas here, but none that really excel in the framework of the game.You have the ability to station troops behind walls or inside houses for cover; engineers can build sandbags, barbed wired fences or anti-tank blockades, and even plant landmines; you are given a variety of troop types from machine guns, snipers, basic infantry, down toward mortars for long range bombardments; and even an RPG like level up skill system based on experience gained. Heck, the game even adds an overhead tactical view as if to say, ""see this is more than your mindless send wave after wave of whatever type of unit you want and auto win."" All sounds really cool!However, it won't be long till you realize all these ""strategies"" are a waste of time and you'd be better off ignoring them and going back to the standard ""build tons of whatever units, group them all together into a giant blob, and just move around the map steamrolling the enemy.""  The AI is dumb. Your troops are dumb. They require 24/7 babysitting with micromanagement intervention for every fight or they will just keel over and die at the mere sight of the enemy (even if you put your troops in superior cover positions). So attempting to tactically spread troops around the battlefield is not a worthwhile tactic. Attempting to move to a different area of the map away from your main army and build up some defenses with an engineer is not worthwhile. These things will just cause your troops to needlessly be lost and you finding yourself falling behind. The terrible zoomed in camera that makes the game feel like its 640x480 resolution from the 90's is just the extra kick in the balls for strategic gameplay. Company of Heroes manages to somehow actively punish you for attempting to play it tactically and rewards those who who don't.As for the battles they are cartoonish. Makes Call of Duty look like a hardcore combat sim. Infantry standing 2 feet from eachother unloading hundreds of rounds unable to kill eachother. Flank some enemy infantry and get them surrounded and pinned down. Easy kill right? Nope, the game has an infantile Retreat functionality that magically turns your troops into zombie-like super soldiers with tank like defensive buffs and cheetah like speed. Up they pop and safely run back to base to heal while surviving thousands of bullets being fired at them along the way. Is this a PC RTS or a RTS made for XBOX kiddies? Hard to tell sometimes.Its not a bad RTS, but its not a great one either. Certainly not the absurd ""Greatest RTS of all time"" taglines being thrown around. Have you people ever played a RTS before? Half the Age of Empires series, the C&C's, Starcrafts, Warcraft, Total Annihilation, et al all trump this game. Even if we are strictly talking WW2 RTS the less marketed Men Of War series is a more impressive feat.Final Score:6/10. Despite being hilariously cartoonish and immersion breaking for a WW2 title the single player campaign has some pretty good production value. And if tactics, strategy, realism, base building, or the minimum requirement of a functioning brain in a RTS is of no interest to you then the multiplayer is probably right up your alley.",notyourbuddy

The characters, the assorted collection of companions, the voice work, the personalities, the playful banter, the diversity on the main/side quests, and most importantly the choices presented at every turn allow you to really shape the adventure in your own eyes.The choices themselves were all so deeply routed in fundamental morality that the story essentially teases, tempts, and tests your conscience and better judgment. You basically have a little angel on one shoulder and a little demon on the other the entire time. Do it! Do it! They whisper, but who will you listen to? Throw in the fact that the storytelling itself is filled with all forms of deceit, scandal, and just about every other Shakespearean trick in the book made it a joy to play through.And of course mention to the combat is important. Tactical, strategic, challenging. Its the standard deep proven D&D real-time (optionally pause-able) party-based combat that just works. I never had any issues with the AI not following my pre-designed tactic rule sets or the enemy AI doing anything dumb. Only slightly disappointing thing here was the limitation on the number of tactical slots for each character as it tended to hamper more intricate and useful automated strategies.Final Score: 9/10.

I might as well mention them I figure:- Despite being the Ultimate edition patched to the max this game engine loved to crash like crazy on a standard Intel i5 multicore machine. Literally every 10-30mins another random crash to the point I'd have to frequently quick save or risk losing my precious progress. Only after I forced the game to run on a single core did the crashing cease entirely (thank GOD!)- Enemies never respawn... ever. If you encounter an area that you are struggling to clear there is no going back and farming some levels so that you can comeback stronger. What you are is what you have. No more raising of gold to buy more potions. No compensating for earlier build errors in your characters. Everything is simply permanent. You can literally be f'ed and have no choice but to drop the game to Easy difficulty level to proceed (especially at the endgame which loves to absolutely f' you hard by dumping you into inescapable quests with no shops to replenish supplies between boss fights. Because of this the last 3 hours of my 60 hour journey were spent in gaming heII).- The in-game crafting was lacking to say the least (no smithing at all and the other skills like herbalism mostly an after thought). I also felt at times the character skillsets to be lacking (especially the general skills shared between all classes). And...making you have to hunt the game world to learn some specializations for your characters felt completely unnecessary (one shouldn't have to run to a Wiki to have fun.)- The shapeshifter class. I was so looking forward to this one...only the game makes it so frustrating to use that I literally abandoned it all together. Thing is, the game forceably turns all shapeshifters into human form during every cutscene. Problem? Every boss fight begins with a cutscene. Bigger problem? To reshapeshift requires not only a long spellcast but also a long cooldown on the skill itself. Yeah, you are essentially screwed for even attempting to use this class. Seriously, insta-shifting the character back into animal form after the scene ends would have been a simple fix how did this game have so many patches and an Ultimate edition with this kind of gamebreaking nuisance going unnoticed? Even one of the most useful skills ""Overwhelm"" wasn't included in the tactic's menu at all for shapeshifters (the dog yes, but not shapeshifters) so if you wanted to use it you always had to micromanage it. *shakes head*- The final boss fight was an epic battle between you and *spoiler alert* the fking P.O.S. camera.

This might sound like pretty standard fair, but where Rogue Legacy sets itself apart from its competition is its unusual character creation and its progression system.Character Creation:When it comes to starting a new game Rogue Legacy offers up three random characters chosen from what basically amounts to a Mage class, a Warrior class, and a Roguish high critical rate class (later on a Lich class is also unlocked). Each is given a random spell, sometimes a special skill, and a couple of rather peculiar traits. Maybe your character is colorblind (the game will be in black & white); or your character can't see in 3D (meaning all the enemies look paper thin); or is short-sighting (everything far away is blurry); or maybe he just has gas and can't stop farting.  Very strange but kinda cool. It definitely gives the game a unique charm that you won't find anywhere else.Once you get in the gameplay feels really good; the level designs are simple yet effective; the controls feel just right; and the enemies/bosses have very balanced/fair AI to them. There is lots to explore and all kinds of treasures to find. Blueprints for new weapons/armor, runes for improving your character (ability to fly; triple jump; steal HP from enemies; etc.), or just little easter eggs like mini-games or developer goodies. It all makes for a fun platformer.Progression System:The second thing that makes Rogue Legacy different is when you die... you don't really die. This isn't permadeath like you'd find in other Rogue-likes. Nope, all the money, blacksmith blueprints, and runes you've collected in your previous run will transfer over to the next character you choose to play as. You take the money you've earned and use it to buy upgrades (more HP, more damage, more armor, more skills, higher critical % chance, etc.) At first, this sounds really really cool! Unfortunately, in about your 4th or 5th run you begin to realize exactly what this means. It means that future playthroughs are not about beating the game so much as its about farming and grinding for gold. Just like an MMO you are spending your time leveling your character up to the cap in the newbie areas over and over simply so you can participate in the end-game content later on. Not only does it become excruciatingly repetitive, but it has the adverse effect of devaluing your progression. You aren't making it further into the castle because you are getting better at the game or lucky breaks are going your way like other rogue-likes. No, you are getting further simply because your character is much stronger than the previous one. You'll be easily one-shotting enemies, regenerating your hitpoints like crazy, or just tanking hits with your armor that the game can lose its fun/challenge. It makes comparing how far you were able to get in one run with that of another useless and thus takes away one of the great appeals of the Rogue-like genre.All that said, if you can handle the grind, the game will keep you busy for a long time. Its not easy to beat with weak characters so you'll have to devote many hours to gold farming if you want to say you've beaten it. Final Score: 7/10One final note. There is something funky about this game's settings. Some controls and keyboard keys have been hardcoded into the game and thus unchangeable through keybinds. This goes for controllers as well. Why has the developer done this? Who the heII knows. You might even think you'll circumvent this limitation by using 3rd-party joy-2-key software, but you'll still run into problems. Its impossible to disable the in-game controller if you have one plugged in thus your custom 3rd party settings will always conflict with what the game has hardcoded in. ****in' retarded developers.",notyourbuddy

Pinball FX2 has some absolutely gorgeous looking tables (37 in all as of this review). Really, the lighting, models, and animations are all top notch work. They are intricately designed and definitely eye-catching! You'll be excited to jump right in and see everything in action.And since these tables are all custom fictionalized works the designers were able to really go to town with them. A giant Darth Vader walking around the table, test tube aliens, Hulk going nuts, the Avengers fighting it out, ghosts flying around, cool looking water effects, lasers, video gamey minigames, and all kinds of other elaborate gimmicks!The voice work on the tables and sound effects are very appropriate when actually used and the physics for the most part are solid. Yes, there is some unnatural ball stickiness that tends to occur especially around the flippers, but I think it is done intentionally by the game designers to make the balls last longer (compared to traditional pinball tables which were designed to chew through quarters.) Honestly, I find it strips away much of the challenge and makes it too easy. You can literally play on a single ball for over an hour to the point you are just ready for it to end.And when I say ""just ready for it to end"" its because despite all the eye candy and seemingly intricate designs I found almost all of them to be a dull and lifeless experience. After you launch the ball an initial voice-over plays to get you pumped up and then... the table just kinda dies. You'll basically find yourself listening to the background music and the sound of the flippers flip'flappin' while the rest of the table takes a nap. Its like playing the old simpleton pinball tables of days gone past where getting the ball to finally hit the 3 bumpers at the top and bounce around for for a few seconds was the most exciting thing to happen.I'll give Microsoft/Zen Studios a lot of credit for the effort, but I think I just realized what made companies like Bally/Williams and Stern so great. Its not enough to make the table look like fun it actually has to be fun. That crazy hyperactive audio/visual sensory overdose you'd get from playing the classics and their ability to immediately kick into high gear and not let up until the ball slips past your ever vigilant flippers is something Pinball FX just failed to replicate for me.I'll go ahead and give this game an 8 just because I'm sure some will like it (maybe even love it) and I can tell the company really gave it everything they had, but for me personally I'm going to go back to the tried and true classic experience that Pinball FX tables will never be able to provide me with...  they just don't have the magic touch.",notyourbuddy

Congratulations your dead. Welcome to Planetside 2. In game store? Enjoy being asked to pay 7$ for an item with no proper in game preview system. Pretty much have to blind buy your cosmetics and hope they don't look like toilet. SOE was even lazy in that half the weapons they are asking $$$$ for don't even have their own models/skins. Gameplay? If you stick around for 5-10 hours to learn the ins-and-outs of the game you'll be rewarded with some fun battles here and there. Sometimes fun little skirmishes other times the big cinematic battles the game promises. You may even begin to think this is a great game, but soon the dark underbelly of this beast will reveal itself.  Nobody plays defense. Why? 1) There is no incentive for doing so. 2) The maps are designed to favor attackers. Try to play defense you will be zerged and you will be spawn camped hard. Its a pointless waste of time and everyone knows it. You'll get to defend for 2 minutes or so then time to just respawn elsewhere and surrender the base. This has turned the game into nothing but traveling around the map in your own faction's offensive zerg capping empty base after empty base. Infantry play? Infantry have been neglected and tanks + airplanes rule the day. Bit of a joke to the point this game has earned the monicker Tankside/Vehicleside/Airside etc among people who have played it any decent amount of time. Infantry's main role tends to be getting farmed by vehicles. Sure you can have a few fun fights here and there, but you can always count on a vehicle zerg to ruin that quickly. The developers have even gone out of their way to make it extremely easy for vehicles to farm infantry by giving all vehicles free texture hacks. Yeah, those things that FPS try to ban SOE gives to you for free. Cover, day/night, camo... all irrelevant as vehicles can see you anywhere you go and one-shot/two-shot you with ease. Go ahead. Download it. Play it. Its worth a good 20 hrs or so until you discover the faults I mentioned above then you'll find yourself getting annoyed at its repetitive pointlessness. Not all hope is lost of course. It has only been about a month since release so there is still plenty of time for this to become an amazing game. All the ingredients are there. Interesting weapons, vehicles, and the framework for large scale battles. The developers just have to be willing to modify their horrid map designs to encourage the right mixture of infantry/vehicles and offense/defense on its battlefields. Definitely a game I will keep my eye on over the next few months to see what direction they take it, but as it stands right now, a mediocre 6 is all I can muster.",notyourbuddy

And of course along the way you run across all kinds of his mechanical wonders that serve as the premise for some interesting visuals and stories.The game does have a few little nitpick faults though that I might as well mention:1) Kate's cellphone is one of the main methods of storytelling. She gets calls from her boss, friends, mom, boyfriend, et al. This adds great depth to your character, but can also become a drag when you are in the middle of something interesting and *ring ring* ""Its your boyfriend Dan"" with more idle chit-chat. Bugger off Dan!2) The ending. It doesn't have one. If you want a complete story you have to buy Syberia 2!  Considering this game offers up ~12hrs of game-play its by no means a deal breaker (especially since these games are dirt cheap now), but its worth pointing out.Final Score: 9/10.

And since the two games are so technically similar (very minor resolution/game-engine improvements in the sequel) there is really no reason to skip the first. So DON'T DO IT :)Anyways if you loved the first the second shouldn't disappoint as it faithfully continues and completes the original story. The familiar cast of characters are all back, new ones are added (even a villain of sorts), the locations (we finally get to Syberia!), voice work, dialogue, and length (~12hrs?) are all on par with the original. There is even quite the plot twist involving one of the main characters that genuinely surprised me. And oh, the cell phone this time around has taken on a reduced role which I greatly welcomed as it tended to get a little annoying in the first.As for puzzle aficionados they aren't exactly this game's strong suit (though I guess the same could be said of the original Syberia.) There are a few good ones like the plane and the large ivory flute (a Myst-like puzzle), but there are also quite a few duds. In fact, some could hardly be categorized as puzzles at all but rather blatant time fillers that involve you walking down a linear path, picking up an item at the dead end, only to have to backtrack the same linear path to the beginning just to click a button to proceed. That's not a puzzle, that's not adding to the story or gameplay, and it certainly isn't fun. Its just pointless. Others lacked sufficient clues forcing upon you a trial-and-error method to complete them. Not the worst thing ever, but when some of these same trial-and-error puzzles were accompanied by either long walks or having to sit through deliberately drawn out character animation sequences with repetitive voice overs it quickly got annoying (I'm looking at you fishing puzzle!).But, perhaps most frustrating for me was this game seems to have introduced a progression through dialogue tree system that I don't recall being in the first (or maybe it was more subtlety done?). Its not enough to talk to people with the same keyword once, or twice, but sometimes three times just to advance the story. I literally talked to everyone in an area then spent 20+ minutes just pixel hunting, backtracking, scratching my head with a puzzle thinking I missed something; talked to everyone a second time, repeated the pixel hunt, only to remained bewildered and in the end find out it wasn't a puzzle at all that was preventing my advance, but rather it was because I didn't badger all the NPCs with the same keywords a 3rd time! Arrrg!These things don't ruin the game. Not even close, but they did sour me enough that I will always remember the original Syberia more fondly. Final score: 7.5/10",notyourbuddy

Graphics are okay, soundtrack too, and the first two or three hours (origins) are interesting. From there on the game becomes linear, boring and repetitive.

Oh, and sidequests: probably the worst aspect of the whole game. Dull, linear, irrelevant. Whole areas appear out of nowhere just to let you fight useless battles for yet more useless rewards (expecially in late game). The game is pretty much all about the main story line, which although mildly interesting (up to the battle in Ostagar i was liking it), is quite generic as well (a great evil descends upon the land, a mighty hero is here to save the day). The total absence of ""true"" exploration, limited interaction with the outside world (whole rooms full of stuff you can't interact with) and boring and repetitive combat really kills the fun for me. And the world is SO small! i found myself travelling from the urn of ashes ruins to brecillian forest just to buy ingredients and then going back! Add to this very few npc's, a party of 4 members which you cannot evolve as you like, since if you don't follow their starting skills you basically water them down (something you simply can't afford when party is only 4 people) and basically next to no ""true"" secondary quests (the npc quests are really just a couple of boring dialogues to get and one or two locations you must visit to complete the whole thing), and I really wonder how it is possible that so many people are giving 90+ to this game. Considering the size (15GB!) and the year it was released i would have expected sooooo much more. There are many games that are much better, for less than half the size and without all this hype about ""choices that really matter"", which is plainly false. Whatever you do or say at the end of these never ending cutscenes, has very little impact in the long term, other than ""good"" or ""evil"" ending with a couple of variants. In my opinion, DaO is a huge step back in terms of rpg gaming. I just hope this is not what we will get in the years to come, although i'm afraid it is",Megatanis

It had, as most of the products in that time, an aura of legend around it. I learned history from civ. All of a sudden, I wanted to know who exactly was Shaka of the Zulus. My mind expanded imagining alternate histories. When you played civ, you got smarter. Yes of course it had problems,I don't know where to start. I grew up with civ, it was the very first game I played when i was a kid. It had, as most of the products in that time, an aura of legend around it. I learned history from civ. All of a sudden, I wanted to know who exactly was Shaka of the Zulus. My mind expanded imagining alternate histories. When you played civ, you got smarter. Yes of course it had problems, it was just a game after all. But one of those games you would forgive anything, simply because it has something magical around it. Civ 4 is, as many have pointed out here as well, the pinnacle of the series. Again, of course it had aspects which could have been improved, and btw the Civ series was NEVER the hardest, toughest or most complicated strategy game out there. Try playing the Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron series, or many others, and you'll see what I mean. Civ has always been a coulourful, entertaining gem, a perfect mix of micro and macro managing, even though the AI was never any good, and some mechanics were certainly improvable. Now we have this..I don't even know how to define it. So, Dear Sid, all of a sudden, after 20 years of pure genius, you decided that people saying ""oh no, I have to actually research a tech that will allow me to build  transport ships and THEN I must load my units on them?? BOORING"" were the ones to listen, while those that made it possible for you to be in business today, those that bought and supported your products in a time when even owning a PC was something (I don't live in the US by the way), were to be insulted in this way. For the respect I still have towards your past wonders, I'll just stop it here, because you know what I'm talking about, the negative comments are really not necessary. You, above everyone else in this world, know perfectly well what has happened to the Civ franchise.I firmly believe a compromise between complexity/Traditional civ  (for the old fans) and simplicity/moar money (from sales/ influx of newcomers) would have been perfectly doable, and it would have been accepted by everyone.To screw up a game like civ in this way is totally unbelievable.So bottom line, sure there is nostalgia involved, but I tried to give a balanced judgement. Civ 5 is a shallow, unintersting, boring game. Graphics are only marginally better than civ4, and who cares about ""amazing"" graphics anyway (in a turn based strategy game). It seems to be riddled with bugs. Gameplay choices are reduced to a minimum, illogical and outright broken mecahisms are everywhere. And, of course, it's a game for 12 years old kids.  On top of this, since it's a successor to a great series (and because it's called CIV FIVE), old fans will inevitably compare it to the previous titles. And this is not good. You know it, I know it, everyone that should knows it. The ones that don't, probably have no idea who Sun Tzu was or where the hell is Costantinople, and are wondering why they can't headshot Montezuma, so why bother. You just want their money.Right?ps I just hope you are spending more money to buy these ""The best Civ ever!!!"" reviews (LOL) than what you made by selling the game. Maybe when you'll realise that alienating what were probably among the most loyal videogamers in history (civ fans) was a bad marketing decision, you'll see your error. But it will be too lateQuoque tu, Sid",Megatanis
111925,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,PC,3,"Aaaah yes..XCOM. So, are you seriously telling me Sid freaking Meier and Firaxis are redoing my favourite game ever? Wow, I thought at first, I'm in for a real treat. Not. To keep it simple, after more than 10 years(15?), I expected more. After civ5 one had to see this coming, since good old Sid seems to have a new philosophy: ""streamlining"". Oh you gotta learn to fear this word. ItAaaah yes..XCOM. So, are you seriously telling me Sid freaking Meier and Firaxis are redoing my favourite game ever? Wow, I thought at first, I'm in for a real treat. Not. To keep it simple, after more than 10 years(15?), I expected more. After civ5 one had to see this coming, since good old Sid seems to have a new philosophy: ""streamlining"". Oh you gotta learn to fear this word. It basically means they are taking a great game, stripping it of most of what today is apparently considered ""complex"" by the average gamer, and pumping it up with cool graphics. This new xcom is not a terrible game, to be honest. It is playable, it is also vaguely enjoyable for some time. But after you stop and think that the intro cutscene probably takes more space on your HD than the whole original game UFO defence, you start wondering. So, lets see. 1) No random maps. It does get old, fast. Aliens are placed in the exact same places. So, if you get the same map, it's a breeze to complete (and it's very boring). 2) more or less the same tech tree as in the original UFO. Now this was a letdown. So you have the usual laser techs, autopsies, some fighter techs. There are two more armors (which you will never use if you know whats good for planet earth) compared to the original, and that's as ""modern"" as it gets. Oh yeah and plasma, the mid-late game uber tech. I remember not developing plasma in the old Ufo just because I liked the idea of human soldiers in their blue personal armors and armed with mankind's best laser wapons, so yeah, I'm doing the same in this one. Game is easy anyway. 3) No inventory for soldiers. I'll pause a sec here. So now you may equip one main weapon, one secondary weapon, and ONE extra item. One. Extra. Item. Next time you have to decide if you want to bring ONE grenade OR wear a nanofiber vest under your armor, just remember the magic word: streamlining. It's not b******t, it's streamlined. See how easier it is to accept. Streamlined, I'm starting to like the sound of this. 4) No more Time Units. Now, this is sort of a meh. It's different from the original, not necessarily worst. It makes the game VERY boardgamish, like I don't know, bloodbowl, or necromunda. I like bloodbowl and necromunda. Actually, one of the games that comes to my mind A LOT while playing this XCOM is the pc version of bloodbowl. THe game also plays a lot like a blood bowl game, including the ""hmm should I or should I not blitz that guy"" feeling (if you played bloodbowl then you now what I mean. If not, well go play bloodbowl! Now!).5) Only one base. Very streamlined. 6) max of 6 squad members at a time. Oh now this is SO streamlined! Old XCOM was like 14? 16? and NO, it was not tedious, it was damn fun. It's a war, you are saving earth from an alien invasion! and you get a plane that can carry only six men?? 7) overall tactical combat is faster and cooler (cooler, not better..),and, yes you guessed it, streamlined! no more crouching, aim or snap shots (or auto), you got cameras following your dudes all over the place, cutscenes when you get out of the skyranger, cutscenes when you first meet a group of aliens, cutscenes when you leave the mission, cutscenes when you RETURN TO BASE after the aforementioned mission..no, I'm not kidding, there is a cutscene for almost every tech, autopsy, live alien interrogation. Only cutscenes in this game probably take more space on my HD than all the games I played in the 1990-2000 period. 8) soldier promotion. A random class is awarded to your soldiers upon completing their first level. Cool, I though at first. So if my rookie kills his first alien from a distance, he'll become a sniper for having demonstrated his particular aptitude with long range etc etc.. no, not at all. It's random. So no more ""this guy is a sniper because you decide his stats are good for a sniper class. No, he IS a sniper, he can only use a sniper rifle. Also, when soldiers level they increase their 4 stats (old ufo were like 8 but hey! streamlined!).So bottom line, not an awful game, it has it's moments. As a successor of the greatest classic series of all times, it fails. Some would say miserably. Will be all but forgotten in a few months, while UFO and Terror from the deep will proudly sit in my pc forever, reminding me of how scary and hard and awesome saving earth in 640x480 may be. So tell you what Firaxis, I wanted to be wise and analyze and examine and think this out before voting. But then I decided to streamline my thoughts, so you get a 3 (because I played it a bit and it's not total crap)When in a tactical simulation you may choose between 15 hairstyles for your soldiers but you can't crouch, something's terribly wrong. Or streamlined.p.s. Firaxis is paying royalties to the Warhammer 40k brand I hope. ALL your soldiers and equipment look like space marine stuff. Even in their light beginner crappy armor and armed with a lousy assault gun, they look like uber cool Ultramarines with bolters blazing",Megatanis
163883,Europa Universalis IV,PC,5,"uhm..ok this is a tough one. I am a huge fan of the EU and CIV series, been playing since EU2 and the very first civ game, pure genius. They did with EU4 more or less what they did to the civ series: streamlined. If this is good for you, then you'lll ike EU4. Personally, I consider civ5 to be one of the worst pieces of crap to have ever graced my HD, an insult to intelligence.With EU4, Iuhm..ok this is a tough one.

If this is good for you, then you'lll ike EU4. Personally, I consider civ5 to be one of the worst pieces of crap to have ever graced my HD, an insult to intelligence.With EU4, I am not very sure. To understand why, one must have some sort of previous knowledge/experience of EU titles.The game is playable, and moderately enjoyable. Many dynamics have been completely changed, such as economy sliders (economy sliders?), the ever present money vs inflation vs tech investment ""thing"" (gone), trade is a sort of mystery I still have to figure out (but it's waaaay less relevant than in the older titles) and a very heavy reliance on a sort of point system determining tech progress and national ideas development (points generated are determined by your leader's skills, so you basically pray for a good leader).Everything is easier, simpler and more direct than in the older titles. Which does'nt mean I think it's better.  I had perfectly accustomed to the old system, so these changes I view as unnecessary at worst and marginal at best. What I may say is that certainly the game tries to play like a classic EU title, and ends up being a slighlty less interesting ""adventure"" than in the previous installments.Of course there will be mods and patches, so I guess the game is going to change a lot.Suffice to say that my very first game at EU4 I chose to play the Pope, 3 starting provinces  and lousy economy. Anyone who has played a EU game knows what I'm talking about. Well, after 50-60 years, I had all of Italy from Modena to Palermo. Core status and culture can be changed rather effortlessly, making expansion easy. I found all very very easy.Oh and of course, welcome to steam. I hope you are not bothered by things like not being able to play a LAN game with your brother sitting next to you without passing through steam, or having to read every time you start the game things like :""BUY NATIONAL MONUMENTS NOW!! ENTER OPEN STORE!!"" which is kind of lame in my book especially in a strategic title (and btw, so I don't get national monuments if I don't pay?).At the end of the day, right now EU4 is a blander, less interesting and VERY streamlined version of EU3. A completely modded EU3 is a much more ""mature"" game.Time will tell if this game's aim was to change the genre and revive it in a constructive way, or to allow people to play EU on their iphones or something.",Megatanis

However, after seeing its glowing reviews, I wanted to see what the fuss was about. 45 hours and a platinum trophy later, I can unequivocally say this is among the best PS4 exclusives out there.The story is moving (besides some exposition dump-style dialogue early on) and is the first game for a while to actually elicit a true emotion from me. The gameplay loop it creates is addicting and fun, and the crafting, leveling, questing, combat and other features, while never anything new or innovative, are top-notch. This game fixes a few minor issues I have with open world games through its fast travel mechanics requiring a travel pack, as well as its collectibles and radio towers serving a higher purpose than ""get another percentage.""The only critiques I have for it are somewhat nitpick-y. One, the map doesn't have a filter option leading to clutter. Second, the exposition dumps early on. Finally, while most voice acting is good, there is the occasional voice actor/actress that is so bad it can be distracting. Really, this game is a 9.5 but I had to pick between 9 and 10 for this review and felt it leaned closer to 10.This game's world is amazing. I don't want it to be over.

I think custom tweaking of this awesome technology will come, but for now I am content with some basics - in particular the hologram attachment.Simply point the gun where you want to go, activate the hologram and watch as he takes the path you were about to take. Often you will see the enemy break from cover so you can pick them off quickly as they rush into the open. Alternatively you will witness your other self hailed in bullets from on high - its not safe out there.  Clever use of the hologram, the armor and cloaking modes of your NanoSuit will enable you to traverse the map without taking any damage.If this sounds too easy - well it isn't! There are going to 6 guys on the other team doing the same to you and for starters they will be better at it. Crysis 2 provides a recruit level mode where you will only be pitted against ranks 10 or lower, ensuring (in theory) that all will be on the same skill level.As I said I have only played for a few hours but I must say that this looks like the final nail in Black Ops coffin for me.",ThatBoyTim
214716,Killzone 3,PlayStation3,10,"KillZone 3 is possibly the best multiplayer FPS I have played. Being a bit of a Call of Duty fan for the past few years and one that only plays Team Deathmatch, KillZone 3 is refreshing and really makes you think.

Being a bit of a Call of Duty fan for the past few years and one that only plays Team Deathmatch, KillZone 3 is refreshing and really makes you think. Most FPS have a class system and the difference is usually just a limit to the type of weapon you can use, yes some perks allow for faster movement and silent footsteps etc, but KillZone 3 has 5 very specific classes each with their own unique abilities.You will have your favourite and there are many that like to sit invisibly with a sniper rifle picking off runners, but there is some much more to this game than racking up kills.  Capturing tactical spawn points can provide you with some extra firepower, jet packs or air strikes and only 1 class can do this the Tactician. The Medic class has the ability to revive fallen comrades but also has a support drone that acts as an early warning system and can hover over your body adding fire power and support.The weapons feel great, the maps are fantastic with huge vistas and scenery that takes you to Helghast and makes the multiplayer feel like part of the single player game.The single player campaign is great also - much is said these days about the length of a campaign in a shooter but we all know its the online that matters. That said I have found the single player mode just long enough and suitably difficult and varied to keep me challenged and interested in what is coming next.This is my favourite shooter at the moment and 2011 has many to come, but for now Black Ops has been relieved of duty.",ThatBoyTim

Sometimes this is good for a game, but not with AC.  The frontier animal hunting gets old fast, and is especially frustrating when you're penalized for not skinning every kill.  I was thinking ""Red Dead Assassin's Creed"" a lot.  It also becomes tiring having to fight soldiers in droves every time you're notoriety is raised, which happens a lot.  Want to do a side quest preventing an execution?  Get ready to fight scoreless soldiers and be ""wanted.""  Want to climb buildings and jump around? They'll be after you then, too.  It might be more bearable if there were EXP points or something, but the game treats you the same for killing 500 or 5 soldiers.  I also found combat clunky and unsatisfying, despite some decent animations during certain combo kills.  You have a bow, but can only carry 10 arrows.  You have a gun, but only carry 8 bullets (and it takes forever to reload).  Finally, for a game about assassination and ""stealth,"" it's nearly impossible to remain stealthy.  British soldiers are ubiquitous in the cities.  There's also a lot of fetching and chasing; chase this guy thru the city, chase that guy...it gets old.  And while some love the nautical fighting and sailing, I did not.  I thought it was tedious. I found myself rushing thru the main plot to finish the game and be done with it.

I will give you ONE keyword that impressed me so much in the graphics department, and that's the word ""SAND"". This game shines with polish I never thought possible in only a few years of development time.

I have NEVER believed so much in a fictional character before, for him to keep pushing on when the going gets tough. If the single player campaign isn't enough, you have the multiplayer to go back to after beating the awesome campaign. Playing split-screen online or not is your choice, the games multiplayer feels fun and something you will want to log onto everyday to play. It's not without its problems though, as there are various bugs that get on my nerves. But overall, NONE of them have stopped me from loving it all the same. You level up from level 1 to level 75, but like a Call of Duty game, you can ""Legacy"" once reached the 75 limit. Legacy is this games prestige option from Call of Duty: Black Ops, except you can only Legacy a lousy 3 times instead of the 16 or so times Call of Duty: Black Ops allows.

Your objective is to explorethe criminal underworld in hopes of creating a better tomorrow. Mostpeople will have bought this game for the fighting. Easy enough,because it's really fun. It takes the fighting system from the Batman:Arkham games. Countering and combining moves is satisfying. I randomlyjoin one of the various fight clubs when I think I have had enough timeracing, doing errands, or busting bad guys for selling drugs. There areplenty of chases, fights and tension to go around in Sleeping Dogs. Thegame is open world, and features side quests and lots of activities.The game has also been said to be around 20 hours long withoutcollecting the many collectibles, which is long for this type of game.As with every game, It has a few weak spots. One of the things thatstand out is the shooting. It's a little easy and stale, and some ofthe controls are slow to respond. The driving camera has become abother because it wants to be behind you at all times despite your ownwishes. But even with these things, Sleeping Dogs remains a blast to play.Anyone that is a fan of movies like The Raid: Redemption will want toplay this game to get a small feel of what it's like to be the bad buttfighter that can't be hit.",RateGamesFever

Before the release.i thought Black ops could never top Modern Warfare 2.. boy was i wrong.Although campaign is a tad short.it has more diversity then Modern warfare 2 had and its just a little bit more appealing. although the lack of Campaign co-op is disapointing,the addition of zombie mode co-op makes up for it. but enough about that,lets talk about the multiplayer!,there are the old modes like capture the flag and such. but the new game modes in the wager modes is where its at. with games like sticks and stones,Gun game & one in the chamber among others,especially sticks and stones came across as one of the more fun modes,in sticks and stones you only have a crossbow with exploding tipped arrows,a hatchet and a ballistic knife to use in battle. and this can lead to various situations you can hardly get anywhere else. the game is just  so much better then any of the predecessor already and then i havent talked about other things like Dead ops or theater mode.

Whether you're hunting or doing missions, or solo or teamed, whehter your DPS or support, it all makes the game fun, but there's nothign else besides combat. No equipment, no real loot, no crafting, no side professions. This doesn't make the combat any less fun or effective, but for people like me, it makes the game go stale after about a month. I played it for a month, and it got old. 6 months later, I tried again, and played for about another month, before it got old again. It's fun and addictiing, but it's not a significantly long lasting experience. If you're a casual gamer, especially if you like super heroes, play it until you're bored. If you're a player of other MMO's play this for a month, have a blast, then return to your other games with a newfound respect and refreshed enjoyment of it. One more thing, leveling is pretty hard. There are 50 levels, and by the time you're nearing thirty it already gets slow. I hear the last ten are a real pain. I only got to 28 myself, on my highest level character.

Still it was Â£14.99 and I was flush with cash, so I went for it..Its not something I regret, most often in RPGs you will be given a gimmick, that while it sounds cool has little practical effect beyond a few abilities. Such as being a Demigod in a popular Black Isle MMO, this never really threaded into the gameplay, but sure it was the whole reason behind the plot.In DKS it is regrettably similar, you won't just be chomping people as an enormous flying lizard, or at all for the most part, it is similar to a flying mount. But it is very cool, and really makes you feel powerful when you do use it.The plot itself is quite intresting, to a degree. It feels quite Dragon Agey to some degree at first, you are a Slayer looking to put an end to a Dragon, but that goes awry rather quickly and the real plot is revealed. There is alot of fine humor in the game, and the single thing that stands out is that it is not a party based game, where PC is guarded and supported by companions and only represents a small portion of the fighting power, yet takes full credit. You will be doing the fighting with your own hands or spells, and barring the slightly bumpy start really get the feeling you are an ancient, godlike being. Able to toast people, cast spells, shoot arrows, stab, read minds and whatever else you fancy.Its hard to credit the game with being non linear, what it can be credited with is being really, really good, and i'd heartily recommend it. Especially when it languishes in the shadow of the comparatively poorer Dragon Age II. This is how action RPG should be done, in this game you can and must dodge attacks using your characters great agility, rather than have your feet glued to the ground.Amazing game, I enjoyed it far far more than I expected.Another bonus I am really anal about is that you have some character customization options, such as gender, voice and hair, which can really break an RPG for me. I like a bit of, or a lot of choice.Being able to choose deliciously evil or snarky dialogue in nearly every conversation was something I liked, and I got to pick my own words. Not 'click here to reveal'.",Lessi

The AI director is the same in Campaign and versus, the infected play as the special infected (Boomer, Smoker, Hunter, and Tank). Of course, some people can ruin a gaming experience, but about 90 percent of the time you'll get in a game with some cool people, or just play with friends (more fun anyways). OK, in R L's way down there, he's also wrong. I suppose survival mode is a preference, but they've already released community map tools. It's nothing like HL2 - much faster and more intense. The lack of weapons is for mere simplicity and a bit of realism. Games like HL2 and (sorry for the generic example) Halo have a lot of weapons because there are a lot of different situations, requiring different weapons. L4D is just killing zombies. Plain and simple fun. Oh, and there was a user-made mall level BEFORE the development tools were released. And remember, this is Valve. VALVE. Look at TF2. Its been out for close to 2 years, and updates of all kinds are still flooding out. Oh, and to prove that I'm not a fanboy, I do have some problems with the game. The AI wont follow you, they have to kill EVERYTHING before they go on. In one section, you have to climb ladders up an elevator shaft. Rather than climbing up, my AI buddies stood around shooting at smokers and were soon dragged to their deaths. Then again, its a Co-Op game. Bring Friends.",SamM

It’s a clever game, very few times have I ever had to pause when playing a different game and think “I could lose this round if I make 1 mistake” or constantly cycling through different tactical options, or after completing a move go “DAMN I should of considered that.”Most games nowadays dumb everything down to be completely generic and enjoyed by everyone.

No character customization - you play Geralt eh William for the whole time. For instance Dark Souls and Bloodborne offer more flexibility at this point.2. Level design. Well, I admit with the feudal Japan setting it's kinda impossible to create such an epic environment like it From Software does, but seriously: must 80% of levels look almost the same?3. Enemies. In each mission you fight literally the same enemy types over and over again. Only few things distinguish them from each other: HP amount and color/armor. And this after 10 years of development. Are you serious, Team Ninja?4. Bosses. They are strong and they are many, but they are nothing special compared to the creatures created by Miyazaki and Co. There is no emotions (like BB fight against German or DS3 fight against the Twin Princes) in this hack and slash frenzy, which are Nioh bossfights basically are. Above all they are also bugged as hell.5. The story. Nioh's story is flat like a wiener schnitzel without any lore.6. The weapons. The weapon variety is pretty poor: all you get are katanas, double katanas, axes, hammers, kusarigamas und three fire weapons, which have neither a unique design nor a unique moveset. Another point for Bloodborne and DS. Okay okay, you can unlock many additional weapon skills and Switch between the stances - but honestly how often do you switch between the stances and how do you manage to use every skill you unlock?7. Atmosphere. Not nearly as dense as in the Souls games.8. Grinding. As weapon scaling is almost absent you have to grind to level up and collect stronger weapons/armor to progress. Actually not a flaw but gets pretty boring as time goes by.9. Loot. To much of it and paired with sucky inventory system almost annoying.10. Multiplayer. It just plain sucks. I mean if you try to summon a cooperator you have to wait forever and ever and ever. Even in Bloodborne it worked much better. Also the way you can play with friends is nothing but embarassing and makes no sense. And I also miss the invaders.Disclaimer: My review is actually an answer to the fanboys putting Nioh above everything FromSoftware has ever created.",Sap-ete-10

I'm not sure why this is even in an Final Fantasy, but it has no place in a single player RPG. It stretches the game out artificially.Combat: The combat is easy, but lacks depth. Holding square for automatic dodging seems like a cop out in terms of making the combat fun. The enemies run around inWhat is FF's company doing? Pls... -.-Let's start with the bad:MMO style questing. I'm not sure why this is even in an Final Fantasy, but it has no place in a single player RPG. It stretches the game out artificially.Combat: The combat is easy, but lacks depth. Holding square for automatic dodging seems like a cop out in terms of making the combat fun. The enemies run around in combat and sometimes you have to chase them trying to get the killing blow. Its not innovative or fun after awhile, it becomes more of a task.The open world design: I understand open world designs are popular with certain games, but I do not think Final Fantasy benefited from it. There is so much open world that there seems to be no purpose other than to hide things or make travelling take time. If the world were condensed it could look better and combat would probably be better due to added time to improve it during development.. They likely spent so much time to make this world and then littered it with monsters to slay. Random encounters in the old games could become annoying, but running around forever in a lifeless open world is definitely worse.Progression: The ascension chart doesn't give you the depth or flexibility other final fantasies like 10 did. In 10 you could really build a character up the way you want. Here in 15 its pretty limited.Characters: The game opens with Noctis being a child as his father sends him away. Having seen Kings Glaive and what happens to his father and the capital it made it more bothersome that the main character would be such a child under such serious conditions of war and an arranged marriage to restore peace. Add on that he is travelling with his 3 best friends who all look like teenagers who exclusively buy their clothes at hot topic and I'm not going to care too much about them. Everyone wants to write about how the story is about these 4, but that's trying to pick one positive out of the game and the story and it really should be about the kingdom and over coming evil. When the story is so bad that we try to make the relationships between the characters the reason to call it good its an even bigger failure. Also you don't really see much character growth from them.There are not great characters that I want to see more of or admire. Go and look at FF4 or FF6. For SNES sprites those characters had more depth than the ones in FF15. Even FF10 had much better characters.Side Games: Ever since FF6 and FF7 side games/activities have played a big part in Final Fantasy games. Here they seem like an after thought. The arcade games are terrible, time consuming, and not rewarding enough. Chocobo racing is okay, but not great.That's it for the bad or I will never get to the good.First good thing is that combat is easy. Anyone can beat this game.For those who feel RPGs are too confusing this game makes everything very easy. Magic is kind of pointless and Summons make it even easier. Plus you can hide mid combat by hanging at certain points to heal.The food looks really good and the boosts are nice. Actually the boosts are almost too nice that in some cases it seems like they lowered the players stats to put more focus on the cooking. Seems like they are still coping MMOs a bit still.The auto pilot on the car is nice.It runs relatively well, but I do seem the frame rate drop quite a bit.that's all I have for good.Honestly this is not the game fans expected or deserved. I feel like true final fantasy fans will have to live in the past because square isn't capable of making good games anymore. When I was growing up they were the top in the industry. Their games were massive and played really well. Square used to be on the cutting edge of graphics and here in FF15 the hair on the characters looks chunky.I know a lot of people wanted this game to be great, so did I. The fact is that it isn't a great game. I don't care what critics say or release day reviewers. The game is not a 10, 9, 8 or 7. I could accept someone giving it a 6, but anything above that is a lie.Now I know I'm no authority on this, but check videos on youtube and really look at the game. Don't just listen to the media campaign. We know companies pay for reviews and part of me wonders how many of these user reviews are actually people square paid to give the game a ten. I know that sounds a lot like a conspiracy theory, but square spent too much on this game not to take steps to guarantee its success. We have all seen the power of marketing.I recommend waiting for the game to drop in price. Its not as good as people are saying. There are far better games made in far less time. Please don't be fooled",Sap-ete-10

Let’s see as we delve into what does and does not work with God of War (2018).Story: The story“A promising start to a reimagining of a classic IP”Introduction: It’s has been 8 long years since we have seen Kratos in 2010’s God of War III. With a new mythology, new gods to defeat and a new way of combat, can this reimagining of the old PS2 franchise bring new life to this series? Let’s see as we delve into what does and does not work with God of War (2018).Story: The story starts with Kratos and his new son, Atreus morning over the loss of Kratos Wife and Atreus mother. Her last wish is to have her ashes spread on the highest peak in the land of Midgard. While getting ready to go on this mission, a stranger, knowing of Kratos past, tries to stop them for unknown reasons. I won’t say anymore due to spoilers but it’s an amazing story. The new calm and collective Kratos dealing with what he did in the past makes for a more relatable Kratos and helps the story stay intriguing. The references to the previous games are enough for long-time fans to piece together what happened between this game and the 3rd installment but subtle enough for newbies to the franchise not to get lost, hence why this game is only called God of War, The father and son relationship is perfect and is the driving force behind this amazing journey. If you’re getting this game for the story, it’s easily one of the best parts of this game.Gameplay: The gameplay is just as brutal as the previous games but it has changed in many ways. The camera is now in a locked position and gives a more cinematic look for story moments and for combat. It’s very similar to what they do in Naughty Dog’s more recent entries. The fast-paced combat from previous entries is replaced for a weightier and slow-moving combat. This makes combat way more brutal, thanks with the help of Kratos new weapon, The Leviathan Axe. This new style is also mixed in with light RPG elements and a semi-open world, even though the game is still mostly linear. The RPG elements work well but I feel like they were unnecessary, with the exception of the skill tree. Crafting armor and dealing with different stats feels pointless. Last but not least, the enemies are great when they are not repetitive. I started to get annoyed towards the end when I started to fight a boss gauntlet of enemies I had fought many times before. Luckily, this does not start feeling like a problem till close to the end. Overall, the gameplay is fantastic as well. Just need a bit more variety in the enemies next time around.Technical: This game is the best looking game of PS4, hands down, even if you only own a regular PS4. No framerate drop and no load screens (Unless you die). The game is present in one singular shot from beginning to end and it makes the game more impressive due to it. The soundtrack is amazing, such a powerful score that never lets up from beginning to end. No glitches of any kind. This game, like most PlayStation titles as of late, is a technical masterpiece.Verdict: God of War (2018) is a promising start to a reimagining of a classic IP. A risk I don’t think anyone would take with an established IP. Having the courage to get an IP that everyone knows and turn it into something so different is just unheard of in this day in age. I applaud everyone over at Santa Monica Studio for make a near perfect experience. Just try to make enemies a bit more varied near the end next time.Pros:+Amazing Journey+New Brutal Gameplay+Powerful Soundtrack+Technical MasterpieceCons:-No enemy variety near the end",dash383535

I have small gripes about the game but nothing was able to persuade me to give it lower that a perfect score.Story: The story centers around a group of high schoolers that get a mysterious app on their phones that allows them to enter another world. When they get to this world, they find out that they have a power called a persona that comes from their rebellious self. In this world, they are able to beat dark desires out of people they deemed to be evil. Once finished, the person will confess their crimes in the real world and get sent to jail. It sounds like a simple premise but it gets more complex as the game continues. You meet new people to join your group or you meet interesting and relatable side character that don't even know what you are doing in the other world. Throughout the story, you level up your bonds with these characters, making each one unforgettable. This makes for an amazing story with a large cast of characters that are memorable and that is impressive due to the large cast. You will be entertained from start to finish, just don't rush through the 100-hour story because you are bound to get bored if your only goal is the finish line.Gameplay: The turn based combat is simple but complex. There are 10 different elements are used when you use an attack from your persona. Your enemy will be weak to one element but depending on what persona you have out, you will be weak to one attack as well. If you hit a weakness, you get one more turn with your character, or your enemy will get one more turn if he attacks you with a weakness shot. To upgrade personas, you can fuse them together or make your bonds closer with your friends by hanging out with them on your days off. On top of your personas, you will have your gun and your basic attack. In the real world, you can upgrade these by buying toy guns and weapons in the real world. They become real in the distorted world. All of this mixes together to make a flawless gameplay experience.Technicals: The visuals are amazing and stylized. There is so much uniqueness in this game. Even the UI and menu look amazing and don't get me started on the gameplay visuals like the all out attack (which you can see below). The game runs at a smooth 60fps, no graphical glitches and this game has NEVER BEEN PATCH. That is a miracle is this day in age of gaming and should be commended for it. An amazing soundtrack that gets you in the mood for battle or in the mood to take it easy with your friends (Depending on what you are doing in the game.) This game is a technical marvel and more RPG should look at this game to be their new standard.Conclusion: If you own a PS3 or PS4, this is a must game buy for most people. Some might be put off by too much story, but if you are able to become attached to the characters and you love turn-based combat, you will love this game. It looks great, it plays great, and it sounds great. Set 100+ hours aside and play what I might consider Game of the Year 2017, if nothing else comes along to dethrone it.",dash383535

I can't believe that the ps4 can handle it. The single player runs in 1080p 30fps while the multiplayer runs in 900p 60 fps.

Only 3 modes right now, Team Deathmatch, Objective, and plunder are all fun and exciting. If you want to be more competitive, there is a ranked mode for Team Deathmatch as well.Final Thoughts:This is a beautiful crafted game that rivals some of the best games ever made. Flaws are so minor if any at all, it shows how much time and care has gone in to the final adventure in this series (at least for Drake) That why I consider this a perfect game, a game that other games in the industry should try to live up to.

The starts out with an outcast named Aloy, shunned for being a motherless child. You are protected by another outcast named Rost. You find a device called the focus and start discovering more about yourself and how these robot dinosaurs took over the earth. The story seems cliché at first until the twist and turns start happening. By the end, you will have experienced one wild ride.Gameplay:The gameplay is nice and fluent even at 30FPS. You have many weapons at your disposal like your bow, The Tripcaster, and a bomb sling. The combat is nice but the only way to defend yourself is by rolling out of the way, which 9 times out of 10 you still get hit by something. Speaking of getting hit, this game is hard, even on Normal difficulty. It's nice to have a challenge but when multiple enemies on the screen at one time (especially at the end fight), it will become little too much.Technical:The Decima engine looks amazing. The best graphics I have ever seen for an open world game. Realistic looking textures that run great even when not using a PS4 Pro. A pretty great soundtrack that meshes the prehistoric and future vibe together. It not the most memorable but it gets the job done. A solid package with no glitches and no DLC to fix mistakes.Final Thoughts::This is one of the best-crafted games I have played in a while. In an industry that is focused on incomplete games, DLC and yearly sequels, it's nice to see a fresh IP that feels complete and tells a memorable story.

A team of androids, 2B and 9S, are fighting with several other teams.When 2B goes to take on a bigger threat, they uncover some clues that might explain what happened to the earth and may even lead to a solution on how to kill on the machines. The story is great, has a few twist and turns and feels complete and is very enjoyable to play through and find out what happens next.Gameplay:A great mix of hack and slash and RPG gameplay. It's a fast and fluent game that runs at 60FPS. Framerate can drop below 20 FPS for a second or 2 in intense spots but other than that, it's fluent. The open world feels a bit unnecessary in this game since most of it is very linear. This game should have been linear or semi-linear just due to the nature of the game and the story progression. Not only that but the map system is often confusing and you will be scratching your head at points while being frustrated not being able to access the next part of the game. Besides FPS and the open world, the game has great combat and boss fights that make it worth it to get to the next part.Technicals:This game looks great. The graphics are crisp and clear. Animations look stunning at 60 FPS. The open world as much detail (even if it is a bit empty at times.). Unforgettable soundtrack, boss music sounds incredible and gets you ready for a fight. No problems with the technical side of things.Final Thoughts:If you love hack and slack games or anything from Platinum Games, I highly recommend this game at its full retail price. If the open world aspect sounds bad to you but you still want a great story and fun gameplay, wait for a price drop. 2 points were decided for the open world, confusing map system and some FPS drop but that should not deter you from playing this great game.",dash383535

You try to get the gem from him but a group of mysterious robot also want the gem. This gem is responsible for taking you to levels from the past that are completely different from what you remember. They also take you to new zones to explore. Throughout the story, you will fight Eggman with robots that he has used in the past with remixed attacks and you will also fight the new robots in crazy scenarios that could not be possible in the older games. The story helps make this new Sonic adventure feel fresh even though it's like the original Sonic games from the 90's.Gameplay: Run and jump just like you always have in Sonic games prior. The only new addition to Sonic arsenal of moves in the dash drop which helps you gain speed back up if you have lost it. This moves fixes some of the slower parts original Sonic games have had. The other thing that is new to the gameplay is the bonus stages. During these stages, you are trying to get a chaos emerald by collecting balls and rings that help you speed up to catch the emerald. These stages are a nice addition to the standard sonic gameplay we all know and love.Technicals: The animation presented in this game are amazing. Such detail was put into every frame of this game. This animation makes cutscenes and the game as a whole really pop out. The soundtrack of new and old remixes are amazing as well. Every ounce of this game is bleeding with passion from the original 3 games and should be commended for such.Conclusion: If you love fast platformers or Sonic in general, then this is a must buy game.

This Phycological Horror/Hack N Slash/ Puzzle game had me on the edge of my seat for the entire 8-hour length of the game. Those genres might not sound like they would mix well and in some parts of the game, they really don't. The great narrative and boss fights make up for a lot of this game's shortcomings.Story: The story follows a Viking warrior named Senua. She goes on a quest to resurrect her dearly beloved from the depths of hell. There is only one problem, she has a mental illness called psychosis and the quest she is going on is a figment of her imagination brought by her illness and the story of Noric God's she was told when she was very little. It's an interesting concept not explored in many forms of media and it makes for an engrossing story.Gameplay: The gameplay is broken up into two different styles, puzzles and sword combat. Puzzle have you manipulate the world around you, due to your illness, to solve sections of this game. The puzzle work well around the subject matter but a few puzzle near the end of the game have ludicrous solutions that made me want to toss my controller at the screen. Other than the last few puzzle, most are fairly simple, some have a few gimmicks but most standard and average puzzles are at play here. The sword combat is more simplistic than the puzzles. You have a standard light/heavy attack, parry, slow down time move and evade move. That's all there is to the combat. Combat looks and controls great but mixed in with basic controls and very few enemy types (except for the bosses) combat can get old quick. This is not much of a problem though because the game ends before it over stays it welcome. The gameplay is serviceable and works with the game well, it just has minor problems.Technical: The presentation is spot on for an independently released game. The graphics are gorgeous and rivals top notch visuals from AAA games like Horizon: Zero Dawn and Uncharted 4: A Theif's End. The sound design for this game is only meant to be experienced with headphones. You hear the inner sounds of the main character head and makes you feel like you are going crazy with her. I am normally not phased by gruesome imagery or with horror in general but this game made me feel a horror I have never felt within a game before. What this game does on a technical level, is something I have never witness in a game before.Conclusion: On a technical level, the atmosphere, the story, the way the game makes you feel like the main character, it on near masterpiece level. Unforchantly, mediocre combat, and annoying final puzzles hold this game back from 9 or even 10/10. I would still highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the material being covered or the story in general. Just Be warned that the subject matter in the game is a very taboo subject, so play at your own risk. If you can get passed the passable gameplay and a very taboo story, there is something special here.Edit",dash383535

I was expecting just being able to go through the SP with a buddy, but Co-Op is it s own mini-series.  Very interesting concept.  However, it seemed under developed, almost as an afterthought (or an extra game mode to stick on the box).  I hope this will be expanded later on with DLC or expansions.  This game is definitely going to be around for years, like BF2.  I debated dockeding a point because of the terribly low ceilings for the jets in some maps.  I have a feeling this has something to do with being able to support the consoles, and I hope it gets patched out of the pc version - so if your a flyer, you've been warned.  And there is no default ingame voice for squads.  You have to set up a party in Origins to use voice, if your not in a squad with clannies utilizing TS/Vent.

Happy to hold up my hand to admit it.

I've been disappointed plenty of times. Aliens CM was disappointing. But FFXIII was damn upsetting. Probably because I'm such a series fanboy. I felt -angry- at Square for insulting the Final Fantasy brand with this piece of garbage.So, rant done, what is actually wrong with it? The problem with FFXIII is that it is the OPPOSITE of everything that was great about the rest of the series. The score I give it is applied with respect to how it stands among the great FFs that it SHAMES by taking their name.Great characters? Nope. We get vapid, shell-like stereotypes. These FF characters are PARODIES of those that have come before in the least humorous way possible.Great story-line? Nope. What story-line? The flimsy excuse for a narrative that this 'game' exposed me to for the 30 or so hours that I suffered through, hoping, excruciatingly, in vain that it would improve at some point never seemed to evolve or progress into anything more than a series of inane dialogues and sigh-inducing intermissions between running forwards and 'fighting' clutches of useless enemies (such is my love for the rest of the series that I sat, simmering with growing contempt, through 30 hours of what I can only describe as being like watching a seemingly never-ending scene of someone defecating on your childhood).Great battle system? The FF battle systems have been revolutionary. What does FFXIII give us? BUTTON MASHING. You will spend the first several hours running up to an enemy and mashing the A button. You'll win, you'll run a bit further, you'll mash that button some more. Rinse and repeat and repeat and repeat, and you keep hoping that as you gain more abilities, you'll be able to do more stuff, but somehow, someway, the button mashing never seems to end!!FFXIII gets the 1 point I can bring myself to award it because it is pretty. Well done, Square, you created the prettiest piece of trash capable of enraging me like this since my ex-wife.SO if you like platform games where you can't do anything but run at an enemy and jam that 'Action' button, and you like RPGs that don't let you go anywhere but forward, and you like story-lines that only make sense if you smoke a little sumtin-sumtin, and characters that make you care about them as much as the  that live under your sink, then FFXIII is for you.",Kendojosh

I need to load it. Choosing which side of the screen you want? I need to load it? Finding opponent? I need to load it? Accepting rematch with same opponent and map? I need to load it. For a game with so little textures and objects, this **** is constantly loading - you get old in this game, waiting for anything to happen.Bottom line, if you are a billionaire who burns money and just want to waste time by waiting for something to load and then lag to death... still dont buy it, donate to charity. It is the only online game I play that has so many, basic problems. It is as if Harada and his team, spend this 3 years on designing hats and tshirts for characters (which are still ugly ) instead of making online works, online which is the only thing making this game worth any penny. Its a waste of time and money, run, switch franschise, as clearly there is no future in Tekken.

Now, onto the game, when 343i took over the Halo franchise I expected more of the same but what I got was something much better, see unlike Bungie before them 343 actually developed the Master Chief and Cortana something that was missing from the original trilogy and delivered one hell of a story with an awesome villain who kind of reminded me of Darth Vader unmasked. Now for the visuals, the character and gun models may not look as great as something like Crysis 2 but the backgrounds are truly unmatched by any game out there and will have you staring in wonderment with each new outdoor level. The sound is much improved from Reach making guns specifically from the UNSC sound more powerful and Forerunner/Covenant sound very unusual as alien weaponry should. Fortunately, Firefight was replaced for something more meaningful which is Spartan Ops that actually give more to the story and you even get a great CGI episode which each entry. Lastly, the multiplayer, there are a few unbalances specifically with the DMR but overall it's a fair game and the maps are fantastic unlike Reach where it looks like a Hobo got a hold of forge and sold maps to Bungie, now with Halo 4 the maps actually feel like time went into them, like something you would of expected from Halo 2 or 3.

From the start, the game was frustrating to say the least. Apart from the slow and seemingly over the top (click on him endlessly till he finishes what he has to say) character interaction, it's not as open as it could have been. The landscape looks great, but you'll soon find it tiresome, as areas you just cleared, seemed to be instantly teaming with the same guys again, after returning within seconds. Plus when getting missions, they inevitably end up being the other side of the map, meaning long and repetitive trips. Want to get up that small hill to shoot with your sniper? Well no you can't, your character seems unable to climb the slightest hill and gets stopped in his tracks by small logs etc. So the open landscape you see, is actually very limited. The weapon system. It seems they have decided not to let you chose what weapons you would like to carry. Sure you can carry different weapons, but if you want to carry say a sniper rifle and an assault rifle, forget it. But at the same time they let you carry a sniper and an LMG???? Then there's the enemies you meet. Each and everyone of them has X-ray eyes. Not only do they know exactly where you are, but can see you through certain rocks and deep foliage. They know you are coming before you do, has to be the worst AI I've seen in a while. Stealth on this game is not and option, because even with the stealth weapons, the enemies know your position right away. It can be the middle of the night, and out of no where a guy on another part of the map starts shelling you, or a sniper the other side of a bunch of trees, starts shooting you. This is not the Far Cry 2 you or I was looking for, or expecting. Sure it looks good, but that doesn't last long and neither does the fire. Not a patch on the first tbh.

This might be why i had more fun with this game. Its easyer to get the cards you want compared to gwent or hearthstone. I did not have trouble building a somewhat competitive deck with it. Ranked it to the 8th level.It does only take about 15-20 seconds to find a match and arena is quite fun. I can see myself play this game a little bit for each day. It was very fun to play so far.

The game is very much like the first, however many sequels are that way. The level design (Coming from a level designer), is astounding. Valve has perfected it. The subtle hints that lead you from one area to the next help this game for new people. The new characters, although realistic and you can identify with them, just don't come out as unique as the first's. Another problem I had was the Charger's AI is horrible. The Charger more-often-than-not runs into walls, and little corners, which can get infuriating. The Jockey's however, is great! He hides, and uses his advantage of being short to hide behind small areas. Scavenge is a great addon too, offering a quicker, fast-paced versus mode that does it's job really well. Kudos to Valve for making my heart race as the music gets quicker, as we grab the last can, and attempt to protect our convoy as we are in overtime. The weapons seem too close to the screen, and the Magnum would blow your head off. Again, these are minor nuisances, that can be ignored. The Hunter is somewhat buggy, as I once pounced off a high ledge and landed right on his head, but simply fell off. There aren't as many memories, but over-all, it is a better game. The new DLC should help this game out, and it could either do really well or fail miserably. Overall, I'd give Left 4 Dead a 9.3. I rounded it, so that's why I put it as a 9.

An excellent alternative to other games that the Need for Speed franchise brought to us in recent years until then. This is, briefly, a hot pursuit (as the title) on a large scale. Driving in extensive roads with the most powerful cars in the world.  There is no a storyline behind the career mode, only a scale level to 1 at 20, playing as a cop or as a racer. Another interesting point of the game is the shift change during the races.The focus is on the online mode, where the new autolog system connects us with friends and we play races and intense pursuits. The game's secret is the high speed (that's why so long roads) and the escape of a heavy pursuit (where we have road blocks, spike strips, PEM, and even helicopters support by the cops).

I find it moronic to rehash the same crap time and again and hope for the best, they said they learned from their mistakes and accepted fans feedback, I highly doubt that.

While the campaign's narrative is much more engaging than in the first one, not having personal victory conditions does hurt the experience a little bit. The initial missions you are given also hurt the experience a little bit for more advanced players, since you are encouraged to take a specific course of action when another course might prove better to you. The Queek campaign and Kroq-gar especially suffer from this.In terms of the campaign map, it is massive. It is so large, the mere thought of conquering it all will make your rat-whiskers tingle, your serrated blades restless, your flames roar and your primal instincts take over. Exploring the world is exciting, as one faces new factions, opportunities and enemies at every turn. This is further enhanced by the treasure mechanic at sea, the treasure hunting mechanic and the increased number of unique buildings available in specific regions in the world.On the other hand, the racing mechanic of the ritual combined with the huge map means you will most likely complete your first campaign without seeing two thirds of the map, which can feel frustrating after having built an empire ready to conquer it all. It will also somewhat limit the opponents you will fight, seeing as the races are primarily divided on the 4 continents. The mortal empires campaign will most likely solve this. Apart from that, it DOES improve replayability.The campaign interface has also had a bit of a fixer-upper, adding several quality of life improvements, such as an interface for camera control during other factions' turns. No more having to closely follow neutral factions' movements! Feelsgoodman.The battle mechanics have also been slightly improved, with more interesting abilities such as rampage introduced. Perhaps a little overly introduced as 3 out of 4 races now has an ability based on whether they are on 50% max health. Arrow physics have been majorly improved and can now have a more vertical trajectory. A small change, but one you will doubtlessly find compelling, coming from the first game.Army abilities have also been introduced and boy are they a blast to use. Summon more ratmen, invoke the power of the ancient plaques, bombard your enemies from above and much more. Players who found their armies inflexible in the first game, will enjoy these global spells that can be used anywhere on the map at any time as they make you feel more in control of a battle where units can be cumbersome to move around.The voice acting is okay. Malekith's voice is as presented in the trailer, Queek headtaker's voice is a mix of weird and adorable, while the high elves are noble-sounding as it should be. It is not incredible, but it gets the job done.The soundtracks are interesting, having most likely taken some pages out of World of Warcrafts book. They are enjoyable for a while, but you will want to have a mix appropriate for your race ready once you really get invested.Overall an excellent game and a worthy successor to Warhammer 1, but does not bring in anything revitalizing new mechanics in terms of the gameplay. If you liked the previous one, you will most likely enjoy this one as well.Best of luck on the battlefields of the New World!",TheRavenousEye

Pit in the 5 factions and you got yourself one, epic game. There are however some issues which need to be adressed:Gameplay:The gameplay in general is smooth and entertaining.

The battles are huge, the map is identical to the fantasy universe most players know and love. Pit in the 5 factions and you got yourself one, epic game. There are however some issues which need to be adressed:Gameplay:The gameplay in general is smooth and entertaining. The core mechanics revolve around tailoring your army to your opponent and having the right dudes fight the right bad guys. Flank your opponent and when a unit you don't like gets too close, bring it down in a hail of bolts and bullets. Sadistics like myself will find endless entertainment in seeing broken enemies get run down by ones sinister forces.However the gameplay have some issues:1. Lord Characters.Being the embodiment of the player on the battlefield, it is not surprising that these guys are true powerhouses. Maybe even on the tip of being too powerful. Seeing as individual models  in the  game do  almost no damage, and characters having a minimal amount of space around them,  it is not uncommon that you can have 10 units hitting a fleeing lord and it still takes like 30 seconds before they kill him. While the Lords aren't exactly overpowered, I think units should have more of a chance against them.  They aren't even human right now.2. Running and walking.Seriously this is a mess. Clicking AND ATTACKING makes your units walk. Meaning if I want my units to actually charge an opponent (and get a bonus) I need to press R.3. Fog of War.Want to attack that ranged unit in the forest over there? Okay, point and click, press R to run.However if that unit stops shooting for a second and goes invisible again? Well, then you have to manually re-assign your unit go kill them or just walk/run into the forest. More an annoyance because of the lack of an attack move button which usually exist within the RTS-genre.4. Missions and Quests.The quest system in TW:W is fantastic, giving you quests based on your current situation during the campaign, giving you these small objectives every now  and then. The missions however, to get some of your Special Character's gear? I went through the entire Empire normal campaign without ever touching it (which was stupid of me since those were easy). The Vampire Counts however, need to travel across half the map to a region they have no interest in and win a battle there. Whether that is historically correct or not is irrelevant. That is just annoying to have to do...Graphics:Gorgeous. Playing it on low graphics is a nightmare (which I  had to with my Radeon 6930), almost pixelated, but it runs excellently on my new GTX 960. Very nice.Setting:The setting in general is glorious as I mentioned in the intro. My only complaint are the Vampires who are absolute jokes. I don't know why, but Creative Assembly has for some reason made them all talk like they were part of a horrible Shakespearean play. They even make references to stupid parodies of his plays. ""You wouldn't want to make the same mistake as McDeath"". Come on. Way to butcher the characters of an entire race. YOU EVEN HAVE A QUOTE IN-GAME WHERE MANNFRED SPEAKS NORMALLY! God dammit CA.Other than that, it is really, really good. The distrustful elector counts, the arrogant nobles of Bretonnia, the destructive forces of Chaos and Orks and the stubborn and grudge-holding Dwarves. Everything feels incredible.In terms of blood and gore, I tend to agree with the public opinion that it is missing. Also, most models have some sort of invulnerability save. Hitting them with direct hits from bloody mortars sends half the dudes flying and yet doesn't kill a single one. Not a single time occurence. You'll see.And yet, I am hopeful.The game has quite a lot of glitches but none which are gamebreaking. The fundamentals are definetely there, but with some patch-polishing I believe this game could truly shine the way it should.Overall the score is 8. The game is lacking alot of things but also have lots of positive sides which are plain for most people to see. The game is entertaining and fun in that sadistic and maniacal way which I tend to enjoy, and I think alot of people would  support that statement.While many give the game bad reviews, my gut-feeling tells me they are basing it too much off the earlier Total War games,  which I have never played and never intend to play.In newer releases I would like to see:- Attack move Button- More non-magic and non-hero ways to kill heroes- Blood and Gore- Attacking makes the player's units run- More Races (Skaven are obvious, Wood Elves/High Elves would be pretty good too)And of course.NEW VOICES FOR THE VAMPIRE COUNTS!(And you can help by donating on www.makethevoncarsteinsgreatagain.com. That was a lie. rip Von Carsteins.)All in all a nice game, easily on par with other newer releases from most other firms.",TheRavenousEye

The more streamlined map-layout, the smooth combat system and the life-like bosses are all part of what has been one of the best experiences in my life. Therefore, did you not like Dark souls 3 in its essence, this review might not be your cup of tea.The Ringed City is no different. The bosses show likeness to other bosses from other Dark Souls games, but at least the first boss creates a unique dynamic. The final boss follows suit with most other final bosses, but has a more frantic and drunken brawl style to him than the others, making him a unique challenge as well.But the Ringed City is so much more than the bosses. As you venture forth into this hell-hole, you are faced with enemies which will pique your interest as to how they work and how you defeat them. You will face enemies which you will think to never overcome and at whom you¨ll scream your frustration. But as you figure out each puzzle, overcome every obstacle, the feeling that you play for, that feeling of triumph overtakes you and... Well. It's not exactly sexual but I you will probably need a change of pants.To cut the review short, the Ringed City is very similar in style to the Ashes of Ariandel. It pushes the player to his/her limits, dancing happily around the border of unfairness, almost laughing at the player's despair.But if you are a Dark souls fan and you liked the Ashes of Ariandel, The Ringed City is the place for you.A worthy ending to the Dark Souls series, but one cannot help but feel that one more game would not hurt the player base, seeing as Dark souls 3 was such a success. But what are you still reading this for? Get in there! That hell-hole won't clear itself buddy. Oh, and good luck.You're going to need it...EDIT: (SPOILER ALERT): There are 3 bosses in the expansion. 2 of them are incredible fights where your skill will be tested.

I actually enjoy the amped up speed of combat. The art direction is phenomenal and imposing as well as the soundtrack. Aesthetically its the best in the series in my opinion. I just really hate seeing one of my favorite series go out with such little flair and follow more of the same from dks2 mainling rather than following what was phenomenal in demon souls and dark souls 1 while adding more new improvements.

Just like 2016's Doom, this game is a fast, fluid, challenging and rewarding shooter. But unlike Doom 2016, this game actually has one of the most engaging stories in an FPS I have personally ever played. The story itself touches on the main protagonist and his allies own humanity and struggle to escape oppression with a series of special operations in a 1960s America over thrown by the 3rd reich. In context the game starts immediately after The New Order, reccuring characters and themes all intact. The game starts you as a broken BJ Blazkowitz, suffering from internal injuries, being hunted by one of the main antagonist of the new order, Frau Engel, a sadistic Nazi general out for Blazkowitz blood after the events of the prior game. Literally being broken, the first half of the game is very stealth heavy, you can go guns blazing if you understand the enemy placements and environments you are in, but since the game starts you with such low health this can become a fairly difficult task. Around the half way point you are given new gadgets and boosted health which makes the game much more viable for your preferred playstyle. Which is a strong point, the game mixes elements of Machine games prior products very well. Visceral melee and stealth is reminiscent of Butcher Bay, while the fast paced duck and weave shooting is much like The Darkness. The gameplay all feels highly refined, aside from a few stealth sections feeling a bit gimmicky and unfair due to enemy placements and the ultra aggressive AI. A lack of multiplayer may come off as a turn off to some, but this does not personally bother me, being someone who prefers a solid single player offering without tacked on multiplayer. The campaign ranges anyshere from 10-15 hours or so depending on skill and difficulty selected, which I find a solid length for a single player shooter, where many last less than 6 hours in this day and age of MP focused triple A shooters. Personally this game, along with 2016's Doom, have been a true joy to play for me. The blend of retro style ultra violent gunplay, and modern tactical shooting mixed with stealth, knock the ball way out of the park. If youre a fan of a good single player experience, but this game and play it several times. If lack of MP disappoints you, at least try renting it or wait for a massive price drop, you may enjoy what you find.",xenofiend95

Also there is a lot of frame rate stutters, something regular to Bethesda releases. I have personally not seen a single crash or game breaking bug after 50+ hours. The games aesthetic is fairly weak, the Commonwealth is on a Skyrim level of boring. For such a massive game full of content, the world is very lifeless outside of the center region with almost every area feeling incredibly copy pasted from the last. Overall the repetitive nature of the map makes the commonwealth weak compared to the Capital waste or even the Mojave waste, this is from someone who put 100's of hours into those two games, 50+ leading up to F4 launch for comparison. But where the game does shine is in the quest lines. The main quest starts out fairly slow but takes a turn for more interesting matters later on. But even greater are the side quests. Many are easily some of the best in the series and make searching copy pasted areas full of Diablo tier random **** loot drops you'll never use actually worth the time. The new features, well they work for what they are but you mostly have to work around them. Crafting is incredibly limited but is put behind huge walls of grinding to make up for how shallow it actually is, and settlement building is only for those who are willing to spend 100's of hours strictly crafting. Most of the time I found myself having to work around the games limitations only to get bored and give up on creating settlements. Overall the game is very good, I can see myself possibly doubling my playtime, especially with promises of extra content in the coming months, but with all the hype surrounding I am still a bit disappointed by the games short comings.

Multiplayer is ok at best though, it doesn't feel right in a Doom game with loadouts and other modern trends. Overall it just gets old after a couple hours and I can't see myself going back to it. Snapmap is also very limited and gives little to the modding community so it will probably be abandoned by most.

I have BF4 and COD: Ghosts, but this game is nothing like those games, and personally I think TitanFall is even better than BF4. Let me state some reasons why I think this game is the best multiplayer FPS you can play right now.-Graphics are refreshingly bright and slightly cartoonish, I personally LOVE the graphics on this game even though they aren't photo-realistic they are just eye pleasing. It doesn't look as realistic and isn't as complicated graphically as BF4, but I prefer TitanFalls graphics. It's also a SILKY smooth game when played at 60 or 120FPS, as you can tell the engine was made for the smoothest gameplay, unlike BF4 or even the new COD: Ghosts. It's refreshing to have a dev chose smoothness, reaction times, and bright colorful graphics, over photo-realistic lighting and textures.-It takes you a good amount of time to die. Being that the devs of TitanFall used to be COD, I thought it would be more like COD in that you would die after only a couple shots to the chest.  But that's not the case at all. You'll find that you can get away after being shot by jumping and wall-running away. And the gunplay feels incredibly smooth and satisfying, even more so than BF4 or COD. Although gunplay doesn't feel as real as BF4, I don't really care about real.-If you SUCK at multiplayer FPS games, you actually have a chance to be pretty good at this game. This game has more strategy to it than BF4 or COD, and while playing in a Titan, you don't have to have twitch reactions. And even if you play as a Pilot, you can use the Auto-Pistol, which locks on after about 2 seconds. The pistol isn't nearly as effective as an assault rifle, but if you can't aim, this Auto-Pistol REALLY helps, especially if you jump and move around while it's locking on. Plus there's plenty of Bots to kill on the battlefield besides the real players, which can make below average players feel like they're dominating.Negatives-The matches are a bit short. They seem to last only about 5 minutes per match. Normally by the second time I get my Titan the games already ending. Of course I'm speaking only of the Attrition mode as that's all I've played so far and I'm on level 32.-Another negative is that battles are only 6v6, making it sometimes difficult to find enemy Pilots to kill. I don't get satisfaction from killing bots. I wish they had a 12v12 or at least 8v8 mode with no bots, and you only got your Titan once per match. I also wish they had a Team Death Match mode where the first team to 50 kills wins.So overall this game is a 10/10. I don't see how someone can rate this game less than an 8 unless you just HATE FPS games. Because as far as FPS games go, this is the top of the line right now. BF4 is awesome, and has A LOT more guns and customization options, has bigger maps and more players on the maps, but TitanFall's gunplay is more fun and TitanFall takes a little bit more strategy other than just being quick with a mouse. And I like TitanFalls graphics better although BF4 is technically superior. COD: Ghosts just sucks all around.",ericjohn004

But it's a LOT more fun when you give yourself goals. Like ""Beat the whole game on ""Veteran"" without losing your 3 lives and having to start the level over"", or ""Beat this level on ""Experienced"" without dying or losing your multiplier, AND saving all the humans"". I do this all the time with Resogun, and without me even knowing it I realized I'm in the TOP 100 on the leaderboards on almost every level. I knew I was pretty good but I didn't know I was TOP 100 good!I can admit that for SOME people, this game may be a little short. Afterall, some people just like to beat the game and that's it. But honestly, I don't think you beat the game until you beat the game on at least Experienced difficulty without losing your 3 lives. Normally, if you lose your 3 lives by the 3rd level, it'll start you over at the 3rd level with another 3 lives. So I don't think it's fair to say you ""Beat"" the game if you lose those 3 lives every level.Resogun might not be for everyone, and it's a little short if you don't at least get 75% of the trophies. But even if YOU don't like it, that don't mean it's a bad game, it's just not your style of game. Because as far as SHMUPS go, this is the absolute BEST there IS to offer, PERIOD!

If you compare it to another popular open world game like Infamous: Second Son, Watch Dogs is about 3-4x's as big.AndLooking at the average user score of this game makes me embarrassed to be a gamer.

If you compare it to another popular open world game like Infamous: Second Son, Watch Dogs is about 3-4x's as big.And it's not like the entire world is just the city. The middle of the map is the huge city of Chicago, the top left side of the map is nothing but out doors, trees, dirt bike tracks, and trails, along with boats to ride in and all that run stuff. If you go a little lower on the map, it's sort of a rural area with some nice big houses and kind of like a smaller city with theatres and different stores and stuff. And if you go to the south side of the map, you get the kinda gangster neighborhoods, and you also get the industrial complex type of place.Another thing that's awesome about this city is you can basically get anywhere's you need to go on the entire map, by using a car or boat. Meaning that a body of water is never too far awayI love the variation and different settings in Watch Dogs. Half the fun I have in this game is just exploring the city.Let me discus a pretty popular topic about this game, It's graphics. The graphics on PS4 and PC(I own Watch Dogs on both)are pretty good looking graphics. The graphics were downgraded a little, but the game still looks pretty impressive. The lighting and reflections at night are VERY impressive, and this game looks SO awesome when it's raining at night, and all the lights are reflecting off of the puddles of rain water. And thankfully, in Watch Dogs, it rains a LOT.Another VERY impressive thing about this game is the water simulation. Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag's water looked SO amazing. So it's only natural that Watch Dogs would have body's of water that looked just as impressive, because Ubisoft makes both games. Simply put, I've never seen such realistic water in any game I've ever played, it looks THAT good. While your riding in a boat the waves react like they would if you were really in a boat. And if your driving in a boat through the city, you can literally see all the city lights reflected in the water.The textures of the buildings in the city and the textures or rocks and mountains also look good and seem to have high poly counts. And during the day you'll frequently see the sun, with numerous light shafts shining through trees. The only part of Watch Dogs that I feel could have had better graphics is when it's day time, and the sun's light shafts aren't present, or the suns not shining. In those circumstanes the game seems to be missing something, it's not missing textures or shadows, it just needs a little more lighting during the day and more reflections.Despite not looking absolutely perfect all the time, Watch Dogs is a CLEAR generational leap forward when comparing it to games like Grand Theft Auto V. GTAV is clearly a last gen looking game, and Watch Dogs is quite obviously a lot better looking titles.I'm sure if Watch Dogs would have only been released on the PS4 and Xbox One, it would look even better than it does in it's current state.Besides the graphics of the game, the gameplay is quite fun. I like idea of the cover shooting/hacking gameplay. It reminds me of those ""over the top"" perspective shooters in a way. And I love the way you can get the perspective of the cameras that you hack, and from that cameras perspective you can hack grenades in enemy's pockets, or blow up an electronic right next to an enemy to kill them. I think the gameplay in this game was really just a great idea by Ubisoft, I've never seen a shooter like this at all. I also love the stealth aspect of it, and I found it addictive to want to stealth your way through areas other than going guns blazing. But the gun play is good too. There's nothing really new about Watch Dog's gunplay, but it's solid nonetheless, and this game has a really good selection of interesting guns.This game will quite literally keep you busy for well over 100 hours. I've been playing this game for over 100 hours already and haven't 100% the game yet. Of course if I really tried I could have completed it in around 100 hours probably. I just have so much fun messing around the this vast open world that it's taking me this long to complete it. But yes, there's a quite a LOT of content, but it is kind of repetitive, but it's also fun.Then of course you have the ""Digital Trips"", which are in effect a game inside the Watch Dogs game. In one mini game, your a giant spider tank, and you basically just have fun destroying cops and scaling the building of Chicago. In another mini game, your sneaking around the city and shutting down generators one by one while trying to evade these robot looking things with spot lights for eyes constantly searching for you.This game is easily an 8.5/10",ericjohn004

There is a decent amount of cars to chose, and there was a sense of progression on the races, opponents keep getting better and better. The sounds are really good and it has totally a ""fast and furious"" vibe.The bad parts: The worst part are the car crashes. It's absurd. The minimal hit will make your car go flying around, and it would be ok if the same happened to the AI, but the AI really CHEATS when there is a car crash. I saw an AI hitting a car on the front, and just went under it and kept going at full speed. It's very unfair, and most of the time you won't win or lose races by skill, but by pure luck, because cars appear out of nowhere just to hit you. Also, the game has a lot of glitches for those who try to play with a joystick, it keeps changing the controls and the camera shifts if you press brake for too long.Also, although there is a sense of progression while racing, there is no progression on cars. The car you get at the beginning of the game is better than most cars you unlock as you win races.

It is remarkably short (around 2 hours) and yet still boasts repetitive gameplay. All you do in this game is explore a house and examine the notes, pictures, documents, and artefacts contained therein. The house is big, and is well done by the developers, but to make a good game in today's video game industry, you're gonna have to make a bit more than a house.  The story is very uninteresting and uninspired. It is also very predictable, as you can probably predict the ending around 10 minutes into the game. That is not to say that Gone Home's story is generic. Actually, this game is actually quite original. But at the end of the day, originality is overrated if you can't produce good gameplay, story, or atmosphere. It also doesn't help that this short, excuse-for-a-game, costs $18 on steam. So, if you are looking for a cost-effective game to purchase, stay away from ""Gone Home"" like the plague. Perhaps this game's only redeeming feature is that the voice acting of the ONLY character that speaks is done well (Yes  well, not amazingly, but well nonetheless).",HorrHeyy

This game is much more simulation based than The Show, and really shows you the GM side of Baseball. Great game for Billy Beane wannabes. Gotta say, it's super fun to finish 1st in your division and win the World Series in this game. Heck, it's even enjoyable waiting during loading screens! because during loading screens, the game tells you all sorts of interesting things about the great game of Baseball. For example, I learned that Babe Ruth pitched a 14 inning complete game once in the WS. Also, the season Roger Maris hit 61 bombs, he wasn't walked even once! overall great stuff to learn for any baseball fan. If there is one thing wrong with this game, it's that you don't fully get the feeling that you're playing in the MLB. There is an optional add-on you can download from the add-on center in the game itself (another very good feature) that provides you with all the MLB logos, player faces, and managers. Still, many of the players are depicted with great inaccuracy, and generally the feel of the Majors is lost.",HorrHeyy

I hope this review can make others who are newcomers to the series think carefully about playing this game.I am about 20 hours into the game, and I feel like I have seen enough of it to write thisSMT IV being my first entry into the MegaTen series (spinoffs included), I only expected a few superficial concepts: demon collecting, dark atmosphere, and teenage/young adult main characters. I hope this review can make others who are newcomers to the series think carefully about playing this game.I am about 20 hours into the game, and I feel like I have seen enough of it to write this review.  For those who are accustomed to this series, please be gentle as I am not an expert and am ignorant of many features.Gameplay:The gameplay is turn-based, but has a lot of depth which lends itself to the variety of strategies which one can utilize in any given battle. Each demon has its own elemental affinities and ailment affinities, as well as the ability to learn nearly any type of skill through demon fusion. Such skills can be ""whispered"" (more on that later) to your main character, giving him a great assortment to complement your demons. It also allows you to mix things up on the fly if you're having trouble against a boss. Smirks add a lot to the combat and can occur via critical hits (via the luck stat or using a skill which is super effective). As far as I know, these increase the damage next turn for that character and defend him/her from damage if the enemy attacks. You have four characters which comprise your ""Party"": the main character (you), and three demons of your choosing. You also have a ""Stock"" with which you can swap out members of your party. You can upgrade your Stock to increase the number of demons you can carry, but I am unsure of the limits. I have currently upgraded to 13 slots in my stock. The demons in your stock earn EXP, but at a slower rate than your party members. This is just one reason why demon fusion (discussed in features) is so critical. The main character can use items, varying from basic healing items to items which mimic full-blown attacks, which helps characters lacking in elemental attacks. Your demons are not capable of such a feat unless they learn a skill which allows them to use items. You can ""pass"" your turn to the next character in your party. This is useful for many reasons, the most basic being to avoid using an ineffective attack.When all is said and done, the most critical point of gameplay is perhaps conversing with demons. This allows you to bring them onto your team as allies. Sometimes they will steal your life, items, or MP, and won't even join your side. Other times, they will immediately join you after you have slayed their companions. You can even ask them for Macca (in-game currency) and earn additional XP for successful conversations.Finally, this is a game of exploration. Exploration occurs in third-person and you will often encounter demons who will immediately charge upon your approach. You can avoid these encounters with swift maneuvers, but often times the XP is more than worth the trouble avoiding them. You loot treasure chests and unlock new areas through exploration.Features (Menu-Based):1) Skill Whispering:This feature has been one of the most useful I've seen from any RPG: the ability to copy attacks from your demons. As previously mentioned, this gives the main character a wide array of skills to choose from and suits your needs for any situation. Each demon has a specific level at which they can whisper skills to you. Once you have learned the skill, other demons can whisper the same skill again to increase its potency and decrease its cost to use.2) Cathedral of ShadowsOne of my favorite features of the game. With it, you can do one of two things: demon fusion, or use the compendium. Demon fusion consists of choosing two or more demons and combining them to create another. Simple, right? Well, it's made simpler with the recommended fusions, but it is very in depth. Upon fusion, the parents provide skills to pass down to the product. This allows a huge amount of variety in the skillsets of the demon you're producing. Because you can keep fusing demons over and over again, you can get the exact skills you want on any given demon. The demon compendium allows you to acquire the demons you've aligned yourself with, something which I have used a few times after fusion to get back the parent demons.3) Character CustomizationLike other RPGs, you can outfit your main character with gear possessing elemental affinities and special properties. You can also specify which stats you want to specialize in after leveling up.4) AppsApps are paid for by leveling up your character to earn App Points. You can spend these on passive buffs. Some of these include increasing your stock capacity, the ability to ask for Macca from demons, and increasing the stat points a demon earns upon leveling up. There are a TON of apps.I have never been so enthralled by a RPG. I've played my fair share, but this is the first where the gameplay truly grabs me. It is a deep and rewarding game, with beautiful presentation and a wealth of variety in strategy.",Ganondork

111769,Dishonored,PlayStation3,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I imagined this game to be very much like Bioshock which put me off if I am honest. I can understand why people like Bioshock, it's just not my type of game. I really didn't like the art style or story very much. Anyway, I think the reason I initially likened it to Bioshock was because of the art style. After reading several reviews on Dishonoured I decided to give it a chance. I am so glad I did. The story is fantastic... it really draws you into the world and before you know it hours have passed without you really having achieved that much in the game world. The game has great characters, a great story and best of all an amazing character to control in a totally believable city full of atmosphere.  Exploration will see you collect runes around the city of Dunwall which can be used to upgrade your supernatural abilities such as Blink which allows you to teleport short distances or the ability to posses rats or fish to access small areas.  All abilities can be upgraded and a particular playing style can be favoured dependant on your choice to be a stealth type assassin, an all out gung-ho no nonsense brawler or somewhere inbetween.  The game presents you with missions and additional side quests to perform should you wish to stray from the main path, all of which are fun and rewarding in their own right. Puzzles are clever and never a chore as is often the case with this type of game. Missions are presented for you to complete and it is really up to you how you complete them. I have never played such a polished and exciting game that genuinely gives the player the choice of how to go about the task. You really can use your imagination to complete missions and in most cases you are not restricted by the game.  Give this game an hour of your time and I guarantee you will be completely hooked. One of the games of the year for me. Amazing.",Lamigol10

Most of my time is spent playing online though and unfortunately this is what lets PESI'll be honest, I initially bought this game over Fifa 13 because a). I liked the demo and b). I fancied a change from Fifa's claustrophobic playing area.  I was so wrong ... and this is why.    Pes is fine in single player. The Champions league complete with official licence is actually entertaining. Most of my time is spent playing online though and unfortunately this is what lets PES down.  I really tried to like it, I was always a PES man in days gone by but it has remained deeply rooted in the past.  PES is so erratic that it exceeds being frustrating. Imagine controlling a game for 85 minutes with a deserved victory in grasp only to concede two goals in five minutes because of a flawed control or A.I. system.  I regularly came across this problem online ... suffice to say, the controller flew across the room several times, the dog covered his ears as I unloaded a tirade of expletives at the screen and the game disc ... after only 2 weeks of play went back to the shop to be traded for something less frustrating and more enjoyable.  I considered the loss of £11 in two weeks a bargain as , had I kept PES it would have cost me a fortune to replace my 51"" 3D Plasma due to Dualshockhittingthescreenitis !  So, FIFA 13 is now my game of choice, it does everyth... MOST things I want it too. I still get frustrated from time to time but at least now it is down to my lack of skill rather than dodgy A.I. or the ridiculous physics engine.  I would genuinely love a brilliant PES game, I really would but until they up the quality and iron out the game breaking flaws, I'll stick to what I know delivers.",Lamigol10

I don't think that Dark Souls is that hard. I'm not even a hardcore gamer, and I didn't find the difficulty curve to be unbearable. Nothing in Dark Souls is unfair to the player. Every challenge can be met with an eye for observation and a proper strategy. That's what I love about this game. It is possible to complete it without leveling up at all, not that I'd recommend trying it. Too many modern RPGs do away with skill, and leave the player's power to be determined by stats and numbers. Dark Souls is purely skill based, but it does help to have some good equipment. I've seen many reviewers complain about clunky and slow controls, and I'm almost positive that this is because they're trying to use equipment that they don't meet the stat requirements for. Dark Souls controls are fluid and easy to get used to. If the player tries to wear armor that weighs 20lbs and their equip weight is only 50lbs, they'll move slow and their rolls will result in falling and slow recovery. The tradeoff is that heavy armor obviously provides more defense. The player can sacrifice their heavy armor for robes or clothing and be able to dash, roll, and survive by evading. Either method works because Dark Souls allows for characters using any type of build to be effective.You can choose to be whatever you want, and the stats that you choose to level up can benefit or even restrict you. Weapons and magic scale with different stats, and the player must choose which weapon to use based off of how they plan on leveling up their character. You can't effectively use a weapon that scales with strength if you are only going to level up dexterity, and it isn't advisable to level up all of your stats equally because you'll end up limiting your own power. The max level is over 700, but for the average gamer, it will be very difficult to get anywhere past soul level 100. That means that you have to be careful about where you spend your stat points.A lot of the fun that can be had in Dark Souls comes from building a unique character, and strategizing based off of the skills and abilities that you have. The rest comes from exploration and discovery. Finding a new area is always a challenging and rewarding experience. There could be fake walls, sudden drops, archers from above, or any number of challenges, but they are all reasonable to overcome. The feeling of success that comes from seeing your strategy for an area pay off is unlike any other game. I could go on about the creativity of the different areas of the game, how seamless the world is, the different paths that could be taken, the innovation of the multiplayer, the genius planning behind the covenants, and how deep and incredible the story is, but you just need to play the game to find out about it all for yourself. If you make your decision based off of how hard everyone says that Dark Souls is, you will be missing out. It's hard at first, but the difficulty level is completely reasonable. We've been spoiled by the simplicity of games these days. By the end of Dark Souls, I was wishing for an even greater challenge. Luckily, the game gets even harder in New Game Plus!",OspreyB

The PC gamers aren't being treated any worse than the console users, and they shouldn't be giving this game negative reviews because they expected their high performance computers to be forced to work at their full potentials. It's been called a lazy port, and that's understandable, but it wasn't just a port; it came with new content that the rest of us won't see for two months. From Software is not a PC developer, and they did what they could to appease the masses. Does no one realize that they would have had to recreate all the animations in the game from the ground up to run at 60 fps? Dark Souls wasn't designed for PC and it's optimized for running at 30 fps. If From Software had rebuilt the game for PC optimization, it would have taken months or years to be released. I guarantee that all of the negative reviews are due to complaints about the keyboard and mouse controls and the ""bad port."" Both are irrelevant to the quality of Dark Souls.

It's fun, and playing the game on Hardcore (permanent death) gives you a feeling of pressure and attachment to your character.Others have said this is the spiritual successor of Diablo 2. I do not agree. There are too many innovations and mechanics that are original and specific to PoE, that's hardly a D2 clone. The only things that can remind of you D2 are the graphics which are gloomy and less cartoonish than for example Torchlight and D3.What I love about the game:- The skill tree : in theory it's immense. Unfortunately you won't be able to pick everything you like, so in order for your build to be viable in the end game you will need to make ""sacrifices"" and ""decisions"", for example sometimes you need to sacrifice a little bit of your damage in order to increase your life.- Items: There's a nice synergy between the items and the skills. Basically you can have builds that only work if you posses a specific Unique item(s). Also there are builds that can be augmented by possessing items with certain stats. So when you create your build you need to think in anticipation.- Crafting: The game currency in the game are Orbs (there's no money in the game). Orbs can be used to augment your items: add new properties, increase the number of sockets in your items, etc.- End game: This is one of the few RPGs that have a nice end-game: Maps. I won't explain in detail how Maps works, but trust me, they add a lof of content after you will finish all the chapters in the game.There are a lot of things that make PoE shine, but I let you discover them.",nomemory

If you are a completionist, and you plan to finish all the quests, you might get over-leveled, and at that point things will become very boring, even on higher difficulties.The next part I hate about DA:I is the potion system. The creatures you kill never drop potions, and there are literally no regeneration spells in the game. Instead of potions, they've added a barier/guard mechanic, which in my humble opinion is stupid. So now, every now and then, you must to the camp and refill the potions of your party.The story part of the game is quite nice in terms of story and intrigue, but nothing epic. You are the good guy, with a special thingie, and you will need to kill the bad guy against all odds. Everything is predictible, and I didn't have any ""wow"" moments like I did in DA:O.The characters are well-defined, they have nice back-stories, they interact with each other and you can hear funny dialogs.The fighting part is mediocre, and quite easy (there are some OP specializations) after level 10. The difference between normal and higher difficulties is only the HP the other creatures have (I think).After 55 hours I've finished DA:I. But I don't have the curiosity or the mood to every replay it. That's why I consider I've payed for an overpriced & mediocre game.",nomemory

Some people say this is a brilliant Fallout 2 sequel that will be bringing back memories from an era of gaming long forgotten.The biggest problem with this game is not the combat (which is at most mediocre, and becomes boring to soon), or the graphics that look a little outdated, but the RPG elements that are shallow. Is this even an RPG game ?You won't feel any real connection to your character. There is little customization, and you decisions don't really matter in the world.You feel no connection to your party. The characters in your party lack real backstories and are in no way memorable. You don't real care about them as long as they hit the enemies. They don't react to your decisions (btw, are there any real decisions ?!) and they don't interact with the world.Other problem is the lack of replayability. In theory you have plenty of customization and skills in which to invest your skill points, but in the end you will have to do the same party build if you want to finish the game. Also, there is no synergy between your skills. All you have to do is to disperse the skill points in way you cover everything.I am glad the game was short because I was bored pretty quickly.Mediocrity is the keyword to describe Wasteland 2.",nomemory

So that's all my good stuff with the title. Now let's get the bad over with: you'll be pleased to know there's hardly anything that's bad.The Bad:Well, there's 2 nit-picks that I have with the title: One is that I wish there was bonus content within the levels.(Stuff besides stars, star BITS, coins 1-ups, etc. Not that it won't keep you occupied)And two is that the hub world is pretty empty besides a few toads and lumas. But hey, hub worlds aren't the main focus of the game. My ideas aside, Super Mario Galaxy still rocks.The Ugly:None! :DSo overall, I really love this one.

The music is masterful, the water effects and lighting effects are nice, but the overall best part about this game is the animation. Its just unbelievably gorgeous. The colors the textures. If I was rating this game based on animation, It'd get an 11/10. As I said, the music is great. There are a lot of songs in here that are stellar, but my 2 favorites are the song from the Clockworks Galaxy and The Final Bowser Battle. Also, there is a lot more freedom to run around discovering things in levels, a huge flaw I have with the original. There are these things called Comet Coins to collect which unlock a whole new set of challenges to play. My second favorite new thing they added was Chimp, a side-villain who is always harassing Mario to play his games. (Ice Skating and Bowling to name a few) These games may sound simple, but really, they're addicting and creative. And even after he gives you the star, you may go back and play said game just for the fun of it. Even small things like hidden 1-Ups and gobs of star bits can keep you in a level twice as long as you intended to be. And not only is the game creative, its really hard. A few of these levels REALLY tried my patience. The hub has been improved, too. It's like your sandbox rather than your everyday empty, bland spacecraft. There are some fun things to complete and to obtain. So, what I have just mentioned here is all the GOOD things about the game. But you may ask, ""What are the bad things that take away those 27 points???"" That's why we're moving onto the BAD. Duh! Duh! Duhhh!!!The Bad:Well, to start, Its either you have Yoshi shown frequently in a Mario game, or I don't think its flawless. If I remember right, he only got 7 or 8 appearances. Yoshi is one of the most loveable and innocent characters in all of media. He's my favorite in the Mario series, and he really should have more appearances in this game. (12 at the very least) He's the coolest power-up in the game, too. You have his abilities to float, sprint, and my favorite, see invisible floors. And I've always loved his unique ability to eat everything. Also, I feel some of the special levels and power-ups (This is NOT counting Yoshi) are either mediocre or horrendous. The new Boo Mushroom was really goofy, and WHY would they bring back the Spring Ability?!!!!!!! Nintendo, are you deaf?! We all HATED that move. There are 2 levels in this game that I thought were just plain awful: Here's a hint: BOTH OF THEM HAD A ROLLING BALL WITH A STAR INSIDE INVOLVED.  .THE ROLLING MASTERPIECE GALAXY, AND THE ROLLING COASTER GALAXY. Thank you for being abysmal. Not! Also, the Final Bowser Battle was the perfect.    .way to end a game on a bad note. It was really easy and so disappointing. You would think, ""Oh, crap! This is going to take forever!"" 69 seconds later: ""WHAT IN THE NAME OF----"" Its not a nit-pick. Its a big flaw. Especially for an action adventure game. This is small, and Mario has never been about story and characters, but I think Lubba is a big step down from my 3rd favorite Mario character Rosalina, who was very complex and grand.The Ugly:Unfortunately, I don't think this game is as great as the original. It just didn't feel as grand and as influential as the original. I couldn't tell you why specifically, because I really don't know. However, I have 2 theories: Number One is Super Mario Galaxy 1 that it feels more space like with the music, the art, the gameplay and so forth, and Galaxy 2 just feels like the level designs put the clouds closer to the ground.Theory Number 2 says its just the Nostalgic Side of me speaking.All in all, Super Mario Galaxy 2 may not surpass its predecessor, (my opinion) but its a boatload of fun for anyone who picks it up.Super Mario Galaxy 1 rating: 9.6/10I was talking about who my favorite Mario characters were a little, so here's my top 10 favorites:10.Wario9.Waluigi8.

So no mods whatsoever, just pure Oblivion.Oblivion came out almost 8 1/2Finally I'm looking into one of the best PC RPGs next to Diablo II, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion! And let me just say, I'm not disappointed. Before I dove into my painfully long review, I want to get something clear: This is a review of the vanilla game, as in how the people at Bethesda intended it to be played. So no mods whatsoever, just pure Oblivion.Oblivion came out almost 8 1/2 yars ago, but I just picked it up 2 weeks ago. Since then, I've logged in over 140 hours into the game, playing it nonstop. The game is just WAAAY to fun to be overlooked. It is possibly the greatest game I've ever played.You start out Oblivion as a prisoner. Based on what I'm told from other people, this is Elder Scrolls tradition. And somehow you get tied up in this plot with a demonic cult trying to kill the Emperor of Tamriel opening the gates of Oblivion to what I can only assume is hell. But apparently the Emperor has a bastard son and he's the only one who can saved the doomed world from Oblivion. And really you're just a side character standing there watching all the action unfold and even though you're crowned champion of Cyrodiil, really you're just a side character. So it's not that appealing. On the more positive side of things. . .One of the most amazing things about Oblivion is the system it uses called radiant AI. It gives each NPC a schedule; they'll wake up, eat their breakfast, go to work, go to the pub, or even, on occasions travel to another city. They'll also talk to one another, usually discussing the lastest news or how much they hate mudcrabs. And all of this adds to the living-breathing world factor of Oblivion, it's immersive and fun.Another thing that totally stunned me about Oblivion was the environment of Cyrodiil; it is gorgeous. Each part of the map is varied and different; there are the grasslands of the Imperial City, to the snowy mounntains of Bruma, to the swampy lowlands of Leyawiin and so on. Nearly 400 locations ranging from forts to Ayleid Ruins make the world feel much bigger than 16 square miles, and they immerse you, once again, adding to the living, breathing world factor.I also really enjoyed the quests as well. The main quest was good, but the side quests and factional quests are really what took the cake for me. I'll never forget when I killed 5 people at a party, and they had no clue I was the killer. Or how about that time I stole a FREAKING Elder Scroll for the Gray Fox? Awesome. Or my personal favorite, doing some dirty work for Sanguine, and stripping the Countess and her dinner guests down to their panties? There are plenty of colorful NPCs who will give you quests like this.Oblivion also features a fast-travel system, allowing you to fast travel to any location you had previously discovered, which I personally like since it cuts out all that unnecessary walkingeven though you've already discoveredthe place and it's kind of pointless having to walk 3 miles just to get there. Select characters and enemies level up with you, in my opinion that's a fascinating concept becasue it sucks all the fun out of the game if you hit level 50 and become GOD. Voice talent in Oblivion is great as well. They use some of the famous actor from movies like Terence Stamp (Superman) and Patrick Stewart (Star Trek). There are alot of cheesy lines, but it's a good and funny kind of cheesy, so I let it slide. Like in any RPG, you have skills and you level up, obviously. If there's one thing bad I can say about Oblivion, is that I've encountered a few bugs. PCs aren't supposed to have that big a problem with bugs as consoles. . .oh dear, then just think about how much worse it'll be on Xbox 360.So that's my review. As you can see, I have super positive feelings on Oblivion. I'm dying to play Morrowind and Skyrim (it's coming in the mail tomorrow) and all the DLC and expansions, and see if they're just as good if not better than Oblivion. But for right now, me and my level 35 Imperial Assassin are going to go have some fun with the Mages Guild.P.S. I'm sorry if I mispelled anything, I turned off the spell check.",osostt2004

If bioware puts a patch that fixes the awful endings (like bethisda did for fallout 3) I would give this game a 10/10.-GAMEPLAY 10/10-GRAPHICS 9/10 (a bit to dark at some points)-STORY(other than ending) 8/10 (would have been a 10/10 if they gave you more chat options like in previous mass effect games)-ONLINE 7/10 (it was ok and it came with a story the same length of other mass effects so it can be ignored)-ENDING 0/10 (wtf was bioware thinking? this also removes any chances of a new trilogy after this because the mass relays are destroyed.)",Anthrex

I had to reset myself from the overwhelming distaste that I had after playing the first Destiny. This game, adds to the formula in the right direction, but it still is missing so much. Destiny still fails to identify it it wants to be a Call of Duty or an MMORPG. Some pros and consPros:- They got rid of those ridiculous scout missions and put in actual side missions that make more sense. That was long overdue.-People may rail against it, but I actually like the silent protagonist. The original character had no character or personality whatsoever and didn't feel like a good representation of me (especially since I created them).-The story while still meh is still the best one since TTK without a doubt.-The graphics are still beautiful (as they should be in a AAA game of this cost)-The NPCs seem to have a bit more personality in the banter of the quests. Make is not seem so vapid.-Super easy to level up (too super easy)Cons:-Bungie hit it out of the park when they added a sword in the TTK expansion. I would have loved to see them build on that with adding more melee weapons like a power axe, daggers, or something like that. A bow and arrow added to the weapons cache of the game would have been awesome. Instead the re-relegated the weapons system to the same old pistol, rifle, shotgun and you can only use a sword with the power up ability.-While they added side missions, I would have like to see them go somewhere with them. They end as soon as they start and are about as superficial as your average fetch quest in an MMORPG.-The global events are the exact same as Destiny 1 except in more frequency.Biggest con:-Building off what was said earlier, I don't get what Destiny is trying to be. Its formula makes no sense. It has less content than your average open world game, yet tries to make everything seem so social and open. Its an MMO with barriers (which is dumbfounding). With most MMOs (doesn't have to be RPGs) you have a wealth of content that you can spend your time doing even if it is mediocre. There is so much that Destiny could offer. I realize they are trying to make money, but still. How about a real crafting system for weapons and armor? How about battalions (guilds) instead of randomly being matched with someone you'll never meet again? As I stated earlier, how about an expansion of the weapons rather than just pistol, rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher? More raids? Longer side missions? More planets (its the future, even No Man's Sky got that right)? Different enemies? Long strikes? More of a sense of danger (Seriously, I never get worried in a fire-fight. There is a wealth of ammo everywhere)? Monthly events (and I mean real events).It just really seems like Bungie is going out of its way to make the smallest product that they can, hype it up, watch the money rake in, and pocket the money off the game and the $500 million loan. There are some basic things even the most superficial of gamers could ask for that would be a good idea, but Bungie seems content with just limiting itself which is sad honestly because this game has the map to be something amazing. It just isn't being done.",CraigEchols

I've beaten 8 of the Final Fantasys and this one is among the good one's. As mentioned the landscapes are beautiful, the character development isn't bad, the action sequences are pretty cool as are the real time battles and boss fights (honestly the battle with Leviathan was freaking awesome), and Ardyn goes into my top 5 of Final Fantasy bad guys. He's like a subtle version of Kefka's sadistic personality mixed with Vayne Solidor's bravado and style.The game could have been better, but it could have been worse. The story was sub-par and the driving in the car was unnecessary. It seems like the side quests tried to borrow from Elder Scrolls style of filler with fetch quests.

55215,The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Wii,6,"This is the worst Zelda game. That doesn't mean it's a bad game though, since Zelda does set the bar pretty high. I'm mostly turned off by how uninspired it is. Instead of someone saying ""I have a great idea for a new Zelda game,"" it feels like someone said ""we need a new Zelda game for the Wii, so what can you come up with?"" The story is the same old boring crap about how you're the heroThis is the worst Zelda game. That doesn't mean it's a bad game though, since Zelda does set the bar pretty high. I'm mostly turned off by how uninspired it is. Instead of someone saying ""I have a great idea for a new Zelda game,"" it feels like someone said ""we need a new Zelda game for the Wii, so what can you come up with?"" The story is the same old boring crap about how you're the hero of destiny who has to fulfill a prophecy. Every single item in this game is based on an item in another Zelda game. And Navi doesn't hold a candle to how obnoxious your sidekick is now. As a testament to how sloppily this game was thrown together, it was released with the most glaringly fatal glitch that has ever been seen in a Nintendo game. I'm sure the developers were all very embarrassed by how badly this reflects on them.One thing that annoys me about this game is that it was advertised as going at the beginning of the ""official Zelda timeline."" I could write a whole other review about how stupid that timeline is and how I wish they could just treat Zelda like many other highly respected series like Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem by accepting that the games don't have to be connected in their storylines. Anyway, since I was expecting this game to be set at the very beginning, I kept my fingers crossed in hopes that they wouldn't start the game off with the Wind Waker Zelda trope of having hieroglyph-like murals explain the ancient historic conflicts that occurred long before this game. And sure enough, that's exactly how this game starts. And the game is full of references to the distant past, like with the admittedly cool mechanic of having time shift stones reveal the world of 1000 years ago. It's full of ancient things because the makers of this game don't know how to do things any differently, but also because I'm sure the decision to put this game at the beginning of the timeline came after the game was already made and so the writers were not part of that conversation. Minish Cap explains the origins of Link's hat, so if you want Link to have his signature hat in the game you better put it after Minish Cap in the timeline!To be fair, I do appreciate the few new things they tried with this game, like the stamina bar and the limited inventory space. But the problem is that both of those things serve to limit what you can do and so are perceived as nothing but an annoyance! Players want to feel empowered rather than stunted, and so those new features fall flat on their face. And speaking of empowerment, I'm sick of the Zelda story trope of having your every move be predetermined as part of some prophecy, which is hit harder in this game than any other. I'd like to carve my own destiny, thank you very much.",TharosTheDragon

It didn't bother me that much because it is usually plenty of time and even if you run out you don't die immediately. You just start losing health like you ran out of air underwater, so you might still be able to scrape by until the end of the dungeon, grabbing hearts along the way. I should also point out that people are calling that recurring dungeon tedious and repetitive, but it's actually kind of cool to return to the dungeon with new abilities each time so that you can find new secrets and get a better score like in an arcade game.I think my main complaint is that a lot of time is spent waiting for your ship to get to your destination, since you can't control your ship directly. You just draw a path for your ship and then let it go, and to make it even more annoying the game pauses while you're drawing, just like guiding partners in Okamiden. It would be better if you could alter your path in real time. Luckily, you do get a nifty warp ability that's a lot like in Wind Waker, but there are only six spots you can warp to in the whole world.Another major complaint is that completionists will hate not being able to find all the ship parts. For the rare ship parts, you have to rely on random chance, hoping they'll show up in the shops. You'll have to cheat your DS system by altering the date so that it thinks it's tomorrow, and you'll have to grind for rupees to afford the parts. That's not good game design.I like the game because Zelda is always fresh with new characters and puzzles and items and abilities and levels to explore. Since it's a Toon Link game on a handheld console, it comes across as a game for kids. But it still provides a somewhat adequate challenge for adults.Reasons to skip this game:- If you don't like Toon Link or Zelda in general- If time limits stress you out- If you're a compulsive completionist and can't stand to have missing items- The overworld is slow and boring to traverse- There's not a lot that's different about this installment in the seriesKey differences between this and Spirit Tracks:- Because of the titular tracks, Spirit Tracks gives you even less control in the overworld navigation- Spirit Tracks is more detached from the Wind Waker storyline- Spirit Tracks gives you a cool instrument to play like in other Zelda games- The recurring dungeon in Spirit Tracks has no time limit, and doesn't require you to redo sections",TharosTheDragon

It's bad enough that you can't warp from anywhere like in Wind Waker, but once you enter a warp you can't even choose which warp to go to from there! And completionists will have a problem because you have to collect treasures to buy all the train parts, but you have to rely and randomly getting the right treasures from the environment. You have to grind by leaving and reentering areas over and over again hoping you'll get the right stuff.But enough complaining. You're a Zelda fan: if you can get over the train segments then you'll like this game. And interestingly, I think Zelda plays a larger part in this game than any other Zelda title, because the titular princess is now your very own sidekick! This lets you get a better impression of who she is as a character, which I liked. And Spirit Tracks also has the coolest instrument of any Zelda game in my opinion, because blowing into the microphone gives the impression that you are actually playing it!Reasons to skip this game:- If you don't like Toon Link or Zelda in general- If you're a compulsive completionist and can't stand to have missing items- The overworld is slow and boring to traverse- There's not a lot that's different about this installment in the seriesKey differences between this and Phantom Hourglass:- Because of the titular tracks, Spirit Tracks gives you even less control in the overworld navigation- Spirit Tracks is more detached from the Wind Waker storyline- Spirit Tracks gives you a cool instrument to play like in other Zelda games- The recurring dungeon in Spirit Tracks has no time limit, and doesn't require you to redo sections",TharosTheDragon

The only real dynamic usage of your brush techniques is in battle.Video games should empower their players with a sense of freedom, and the lack of freedom in this game is painfully felt. You are no longer able to go in the water so large portions of Japan have become unavailable to you, although much of the game is spent waiting for your partner to do some exploring for you, excruciatingly slowly. Invisible walls block your path at every turn. You can't even jump off ledges in most spots, which has something to do with how large areas like Shinshu Field are sectioned off into smaller areas that are presumably easier for the DS to handle. Okamiden is much more linear than Okami, and the icing on the cake is that once you enter the final dungeon you cannot go back to find all the secrets with your full arsenal of brush techniques.

It was the first game to truly make me believe that video games could be used to tell a compelling narrative with characters that provoked an emotional attachment. In essence, Mass Effect, and the work done by BioWare was revolutionary in demonstrating how video games could be used to create an interactive story. In having to make a choice between one character's life or another about half-way through the adventure, I found myself genuinely sorrowful at the death of a character, just as I would be in film, television or literature. Very well done, BioWare.Only point I would make as a critic of the game was that it was almost over-scored. The soundtrack for the game is absolutely brilliant. But nearly every environment has a song that is constantly playing in the background. At points, I found this actually distracting from the storyline.",Circadia

The people responsible for it should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail.  For all those of you who would respond ""Most of it was pretty good, so you are just an unreasonable jerk for making a big deal out of a bad ending"" or ""It is their work of art, so chill man,"" let me put it this way:Mass Effect 3 is like meeting a hot chick at a bar.  You hit it off real well, see a movie together and have a nice dinner.  In the cab on the way home, she shows you some special tricks she can do with those full red lips of hers.  Eventually, you get her upstairs and disrobed, only to find out that ""she"" is really a ""he""  (Assuming you are not into that, OK?) .  That extra sausage in the fridge might not seem like much to some, but if you wanted tacos for dinner it's a pretty big freaking deal.  And yeah, sure, 95% of the date was pretty awesome, but that last part kind of spoiled the whole thing for you...After 5+ years, 3 games and 200+ hours of combined play and replay, I think we all deserved better.  So dear Bioware/EA:  Fix the damn ending (Internet threads on Indoctrination Theory could give you some good ideas)!  It does not have to be sunshine and rainbows, but it should at least follow canon, make some logical sense, answer more questions than it raises and give me a feeling that all my Shepard's sacrifice and work over the past 5 years had some meaning.",ROGUE-BOLO

Diplomacy is worse. Diplomacy with city states is just laughable in its stupid simplicity (you just pay cash to buy points, straightforward as that). Gone is the choosing of governments - you get to keep all civics earned to the end of time, eliminating deep play and any resemblance to real governments. Combat is actually worse than in IV - one unit per tile! Gone are the Stacks of Doom, say hello to the Carpet of Doom! Land units become weak transports at sea - but no convoys - one unit per tile! And cities just defend themselves like some damn forts. Ridiculous! And - one leader per civ. Not even multiple DLCs change that.There are however a few things done good. Hex tiles are nice. Border spread is better, one tile not entire range, and you can buy land. Ranged bombardment is back - though I don't get it how riflemen can't have it while archers do. Graphics are noticeably better. Great people can build special improvements on tiles, and this is quite neat.Gameplay is even interesting, but seriously lacking the full depth of previous titles.

Musically and thematically, you will hear and feel one of the most impressive gamesI've sat through some very interesting games in my life. Mass Effect, Assassins Creed, Rock Band, The World Ends With You. The list goes on and on. But LA Noire, wow. LA Noire deserves  to be on a list of it's own. Visually and technically, you will see  one of the most impressive games of our generation. Musically and thematically, you will hear and feel one of the most impressive games of your lifetime.You, for the most part, play Cole Phelps, a decorated war hero turned beat cop then detective for the LAPD in the late 1940's. It's just after the end of World War 2, and we see a city not only growing into the city we know it to be today, but also healing from the scars of what the war truly did to it and the world as a whole. people who thought they'd be coming home to hero's praise are working dead end jobs and losing their minds. Families are picking up the pieces after their husbands and fathers come home with scars far deeper than the eye can see. Fear  of communism and the red menace is everywhere, as are monsters who are willing to advance by taking advantage of everybody they see.The technological advances shown in this game will either be a boon or a curse for all forthcoming titles of similar design. The visuals provided in facial features and gestures is unprecidented. There has never been a game to have this calibre of detail. When you look at Cole and he's upset, or he's angry, or he's intense, you know it, and you feel it. It's not just  from the unbelievable facial features and gestures provided, it's from the incredible voice acting and scripting. It's from the entire atmosphere that truly captures your imagination and wholly envelopes you as you  watch the story unfold.There are 5 main types of gameplay involved. there is investigation, interrogation, driving, gunfighting, and action/brawling. In investigation, you survey crime scenes and discern what possibly could have happened. You gather clues and interview witnesses. It's not as difficult as it sounds, as the interface is incredibly user friendly, and your controller rumbles whenever  you come across a clue, even if it may be  hard to find. Not everything you see is useful either, but generally your trained gumshoe is able to tell you if the item is useless or not. Given that this is 1947 and not modern day CSI, you'll almost cringe at some of the things you'll see the detectives do with evidence, such as taking a dead body, slogging it over, grabbing the face, hands, and clothing. You'll go through it, looking for evidence or clues, with no concerns for destroying possible hidden evidence. In interrogation mode, you'll generally be sitting across from someone and asking them questions, trying to get the truth out of them using your skills and intuition as a detective. This is where the technology of fantastic facial features really shines, as youu must watch facial features and gestures to see if someone is lying to you or not. This can get difficult at times, given the situation. Sometimes you might get better information from someone if you go easy on them, like when you interview a child. They are generally afraid, or trying to protect someone they love.The car driving is simply flawless. Your control over a vehicle is very simple. Left trigger is gas, right trigger is break. If you want to take a turn sharper, simply tap the left trigger to do a sort of handbreak turn. The AI drivers can be a little dumb, but once  again, it is 1947, and regulations for driving credentials were far less stringent back in the day, thus explaining this to a degree.The shooting and action/brawling segments are almost minigames in a sense. They are generally short sections at the end of a running or driving sequence where you either shoot a fleeing suspect to death or beat him to a pulp. The control in both sections is quite good, as shooting is a pleasure, and fighting, while tangly, is easily completed as well. This isn't a shooter or fighting game, this is a detective, thriller murder mystery. If there was too much of one or the other, you'd lose the true value of the game itself.LA Noire is not just a game, it is an experience. Not since my trying Super Mario 64 have a felt this sense of ""wow"" when playing a game. Mario 64 ushered in an era of real 3D gaming, far more than most of the inferior titles that claimed the same before it. LA Noire has ushered in a era of true ""immersion"". Yo will genuinely feel for every tough decision, grieving wife or husband, for every scared or abused child. There are no punches pulled, it is full on gruesome for bad scenes, full on joy for good scenes.This is a must game for anyone who has ever said ""I like video games"". It's not my favorite title by any means, but it ranks up there in the amazement and wow factor. Play this game. Experience the next generation of gaming, before it happens.",CDGaming
223538,Child of Eden,Xbox360,8,"This week I was romanced by the thought of a Kinect game that I actually was interested in. Several review sites around the web, including my personal favorite IGN, say that this is the title that we were all waiting for, this is Eden.Child of Eden is a Kinect friendly (but controller capable) game for Xbox 360. If you don't have a kinect, don't bother. This title is MADE for motionThis week I was romanced by the thought of a Kinect game that I actually was interested in. Several review sites around the web, including my personal favorite IGN, say that this is the title that we were all waiting for, this is Eden.Child of Eden is a Kinect friendly (but controller capable) game for Xbox 360. If you don't have a kinect, don't bother. This title is MADE for motion control. The story? From what I could make out of it, it's sometime in the future, the internet is now called Eden, and mankind has moved into space, and there is a girl in a garden that needs saving... from Eden... thus the internet is eating a little girl. Hmm.If that sounds confusing to you, welcome to the club. It sounds completely asinine to me. Don't take that as a bad thing though, as this title is about the game itself, NOT the story. I never thought that this was able to happen.At it's root, Eden is a shooter title, but one, for lack of a better term, is Euro'ed up. Techno trance music, enhanced by your shooting capabilities, washes over you as you move yourself about shooting the likes of glowing worms, insects, and possible parasites. The neon colours are not just pretty things, they are not just '90's flash back, they are engaging and well planned. You have two styles of weapons. Your left hand is a machine styled light gun. It is fast and easy to use, but not very powerful. Your right hand is a lock on missile light gun.To call what you have guns is unfair, as this is the simplest way to describe what you have. They aren't guns though, they are more... sprayers? I'm not sure exactly how to describe it. But they work and work well. The motion control has very little to no lag, which is, to this point in Kinect life, unheard of . You seemingly can only have one or the other active at once, but that may change on later levels.If you like Robert Myles, a techno trance spinner from the mid to late '90's, then the soundtrack to this game will be right up your alley. Even in tense moments of the game, you will be tappin your toes to this very engaging title. Everything you do in the game adds to the musical experience, as shooting flying octopus' and eboli virus look a likes chimes notes that magically blend into the score perfectly.The motion on screen, while technically is ""on rail"" (definition of a rail shooter: see ""House of the Dead"" or ""Time Crisis"") is movable to a point to where you can pan around on screen and shoot at things that may have left your line of sight.Is Child of Eden worth getting a Kinect for? No. Not yet anyway, as the title is, at it's heart, a shooter title with a wacked out sense of style. Is it a good game? ABSOLUTELY. It's an experience that while not completely new, is fresh, and really fun to look at and even to play.The game is short, but it's a ""play a million times"" game. It's something to show off to your friends, when they say ""Is Kinect worth it?"" The Kinect has been a shameful disappointment thus far, but this game truly sets the bar higher on almost every level. It is what people say is ""an experience to play"", it's just that the experience is short and becomes a little repetitive. There are lots of things to unlock, and there are challenge modes as well. Hopefully, there will be some DLC levels in the future as well. You will come back to play this, just to see the difference of what real game planning is like.C",CDGaming

I never enjoyed playing a video game as much as I enjoyed playing Mass Effect 2. To be honest I personally am not a fan of Sci-fi, space themes and what not, but this is amazing and unique to your everyday playthrough of Call of Duty multiplayer. Everything about this game is brilliant in my opinion, we all have different tastes, but if you like action and decision based consequences which can be brought forward to Mass Effect 3, if you decide to get it, this is your game!",Joh1993W

33439,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,PC,6,"I think this game went for quantity over quality and it really hurt it.

The graphics are better than what we've seen before from Bethesda, but nothing special. The sound quality was pretty good andI think this game went for quantity over quality and it really hurt it. I'm not really an Elder Scrolls fan I've always liked the Fallout series better, but I have to say that Skyrim was the first Elder Scrolls title I cared to play through. My experience is varied. The graphics are better than what we've seen before from Bethesda, but nothing special. The sound quality was pretty good and the music was the same. The story line was avarage, nothing too big. But now let's go to the things, that I didn't like. The side quests for example. There were a lot of side quests in these game I can give it that, but aside from a couple they didn't really feel intresting. The same goes with companions. There were like a million of them, but they didn't have the slightest bit of character. I'd much rather have 7 unique companions with backstories and own quest lines like in Fallout, than 10 million of them that only differ in looks, and will eventually end up as moving chests that carry your stuff around. The armors and weapons are not balanced whatsoever. The spells get really weak later on, and if u don't dual wield you're basically not playing the game right. I can't count the times I got killed by a bandit wearing leather armor and an iron knife, while I had my Dragon armor, and ebony hammer on. Just because I wasn't dual wielding. The ""skill trees"" in this game are pretty dumb too. Some of them has no use. For instance lockpicking is pretty useless, since it just makes it easier to open locks, but you don't really need it since it's not really hard anyways, and you can open the lock after 2 or 3 triest most of the time. Blacksmithing is ridiclously imbalanced on the other hand. First of all since every item you craft increases your skill by the same amount to get it to max you'll end up making thousands of Iron Daggers. The gear you can make with blacksmithing is also often two or three times stronger than the one you can find. Dragons are pretty intresting, but after killing 3 or 4 them you'll have enough dragon bones and scale, so meeting them will be an annoyance instead of a cool thing. The interface is a buggy pile of steaming poop. Even if you point at the right thing you'll often end up clicking on something else. The inventory screen is a complete disaster. The gane was obviously made with consoles in mind. All in all this game wanted too much, and ended up as shallow non-polished disappointment.",Zerasad

BUT what really kills the game for me is the free to play model. You can unlock classes relatively easily, but certain weapons require crazy amounts of in-game currency. For instance if u play let's say 3 matches everyday in a row and u do exceptionally well in every single one, win all 3 and get the first win of the day bonus every single day, it would still take you around 30-40 days to unlock 1 weapon for a 1 class. And that's just 1 weapon. And these weapons are not even that special. They are just ordinary weapons that other classes can have, a Spinfusor for instance (works like a rocket launcher). And since in my experience explosive weapons are far easier to use and unless you are really skilled with non-explosive a lot more effective, it really sets back some classes. So if you want to play with another clas you'll have to grind day and night to get to the level of the others.",Zerasad

151617,Bloodborne: The Old Hunters,PlayStation4,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        What a fantastic addition to my Game of the Year. The Old Hunters adds three huge areas, five bosses, armor sets, and sixteen new weapons (eleven right hand, five left hand) for twenty bucks. It's a steal, hunters.It's more Bloodborne really, except darker, more twisted, and more difficult. I ran my level 260 through, on NG++, and had a helluva time. It's certainly less forgiving than anything in the vanilla game. Three of the five new boss fights are some of the best in the game, and all three of the new areas, even the opening, reskinned Hunter's Nightmare, are iconic and memorable, both visually and aurally.The weapons are badass. One knock against the vanilla game was the lack of variety in builds. The Old Hunters remedies that through the addition of the new weapons, but especially to Bloodtinge and Arcane builds. Most of the new weapons have unique movesets and are just plain fun to use, like the Whirligig Saw and the Bloodletter. Also, The Old Hunters adds three new Hunter's Tools to bolster Arcane builds.The Old Hunters is great and exceedingly difficult. I got about fourteen hours out of it on one character, but I'll be running all my characters through it. It's so fun and the weapons are so awesome and I can't wait to go through it again.",an_ill_wind

The Grind is addicting and fun to play because of the loot you accumulate, the progression of your party (both levels and job levels/skills), and because of the robust job system.

Still, at times the game made me want to throw the controller against the wall, but it's those hard passages that gave me the sense of accomplishment once I mastered them.For the most part, getting through various screens and passages feels like finding the solution to a puzzle, figuring out where to jump and when to dash, which wall to hang on to, etc. Then it comes down to perfect timing, especially when trying to collect the optional strawberries that are scattered throughout the game. But the real challenge are the B-sides. B-sides are unlocked by finding hidden collectibles. They are harder versions of the main chapters, with completely new screens/level layouts and passages.Without giving away every little detail, I just want to point out that there is a lot of content in the game, many things to discover and legit playing through everything the game has to offer will keep you busy for quite a while.",Snyx

If there is one thing the developer exceeded at, it's making a mediocre game look good.Yes, this game has great graphics, but that's pretty much it. The story is a mix of rehashed movie plots and was seemingly written in hindsight to accommodate the main idea of fighting robot animals. This wouldn't be a problem, if those fights were actually somewhat interesting. But for the most part, combat in Horizon Zero Dawn is a monotonous cycle of performing dodge rolls and shooting arrows, with a few melee attacks now and then.The sidequests are among the most boring I've ever seen in a video game. They only differ in the form of the cheesy story the quest giver will tell you. They all follow the same formula: Go to point A and examine the area, follow footsteps to point B and examine the area, follow footsteps to point C and...you get the idea.  Eventually you find whatever it is you were looking for and can return to the quest giver.Weapons, customizations and perks are meaningless and arbitrary; a tacked on, low effort attempt to add some RPG flavor to a bland open world game. The only thing this game is rich in, is map icons. You will find a lot of locations that promise some sort of activity, too bad it will always feel like the exact same thing you did 10 minutes ago.",Snyx

There is another button that you press to warp across the screen and strike your foe from a distance, but that's basically it in terms of offensive maneuvers.Speaking of boring, the game lets you watch a car drive through the scenery to travel the lands of Whateverland. You can not steer the car other then turn left or right at crossroads. It's on autopilot for most of the time and you just watch as it drives down the road and listen to the childish banter between the characters inside the car.The quests are tedious, and literal fetch quest. The same guy will send you to different spots over and over again to collect dog tags for example. These quests just boil down to a few minutes of watching the car drive, arrive at the general location, go to the map marker, fight a small group of easy creatures, pick up the dog tags and watch the car drive back to collect your reward.Other quests make you comb through an open area to find and collect small things. These quests will test your patience and have you running in circles over and over again, looking behind every rock until you finally find the last little quest item.There are a few noteworthy things, like nice graphics and animation. Some of the bigger creatures look good as well, but the combat in this game is just so bad that it doesn't matter what you're fighting, it feels meaningless.Add to all of this a shallow story, bad voice acting and overall strange moments like you and your party riding on the back of pink birds while acting like a group of eight year olds, and you know why after 12 hours of forcing myself to keep playing, I eventually just quit.",Snyx

There was no point in purchasing the items as I would never die any way although I did it just for the heck of it since you need to spend your rupees on something I guess. The mini games to earn pieces of hearts aren't that great either.I guess by the time you finish the main game (10-12 hours) you will feel like it just wasn't worth the price you had to pay for it.

The first is the world which is much more linear than the other games meaning you never really get that feeling of the different parts of the world coming together. The other is the difficulty spread which feels very uneven at times. I found myself being stuck on certain bosses for hours at a time and then breezing through other portions of the game with hardly a death to speak of.

I don't care about getting to max level at everything as fast as possible, I think that's a waste of time.

Every nook and cranny is carefully crafted and whoever wanders off will find unique experience nobody in your guild might see. That was a big thing in Warcraft 3, you don't have to explore but if you do you will be rewarded. The same thing applies to the dungeons, there are chests hidden throughout detailed side paths and I get irritated when the party just wants to finish it ASAP. What do you buy these games for?

One guy even went so far to say that Quantum Break was a 10.....c'mon man....stop kidding yourself. He also gave Halo 5 a 10 out of 10 and Halo 5 is the worst Halo of the entire series.Now for the review:If you've played all of the previous Uncharted games and the Last of us, then you will definitely not be disappointed. The same gorgeous cinematics, the same great game play and the same ridiculously awesome character development that these game have offered time and time again. Naughty Dog hasn't missed a beat with Uncharted 4 and I'm glad they took the time to postpone it a few times to make sure everything was as great as it is now.The single player campaign is as great as every other one. Would I say it's the best one? I would say it's hard to beat Uncharted 2 but it's definitely neck and neck. Once I give it a couple of more play throughs, I can definitely give that final verdict at another time. The story drags a little bit in some parts but it isn't as disappointing as some of the critic reviews have said. I was really hoping they would add the crafting and upgrading features that The Last Of Us had, but it isn't a deal break. The game is so fluid and so remarkable that these little features can be passed on. The character interactions are amazing. There's literally parts where if you're climbing on a wall and your brother Sam is next to you, if you have to get over and across from where he is hanging on to, you will grab on his shoulders and then move. These little details is what makes this game great. Most games would make you go around the other character. Theres so much detail in this game it makes you appreciate the amount of work and effort that ND put into it. Simple gestures, body movements and on the fly speaking make the game remarkable.The multiplayer is even better than before. I admit, I was a Last of Us multiplayer addict. They added something to PVP in the LAst of Us that no one else was doing and it felt so refreshing to play that game time and time again. I'm glad they brought a good bit of those PVP elements in the Last of us to UC4. Getting kills gets you points, those points are used to upgrade your abilities or whatever else you have available. You get 4 slots of upgrades to you character with a couple of slots for upgrades to your guns as well. The perks and passive abilities are awesome. You can buy a AI helper that follows you around with in match currency that you get from kills, assists and KOs. These AI helpers can be one of three people; A Healer, A Sniper or a Tank. The tank follows you around where you go and starts mowing down people in sight. Think of these things as sort of a Kill Streak reward. There's also the ""super"" abilities, as Iike to call them. I believe there are 4 different abilities to choose from. Once you get enough funds to purchase it, you get one and when you see a group of enemies close by, drop that super off and start raking in the kills and ko's! There's also an ability that you set down that auto revives any of your fellow teammates that haven't been ko'd yet.This is one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life and I will suggest it to anyone. Once the story is done the PVP aspect of the game is so refreshing and fun that you can play it for multiple hours and wonder where the time has gone. There is so much replay power with the PVP portion of the game and I was so impressed with it because most games that have great single player campaigns usually lack in the MP area. This is one of those games that do them both very well, just like the last of us did.",DrugsAreGood4U

Arguably, we'll never see the level they reached in Witcher I simply because the game is more mainstream now than back then, but the structuring of the narrative is impressive and the choices made and how they affect the final outcome make sense and feel smooth. The only word of caution is that some choices made regarding the romantic outcomes are made very early and are irreversible so if you care a lot about that aspect, I recommend finding a short post about it that doesn't spoil too much before you play the game too far. The choices regarding Ciri's story are just splendid, she comes alive as a complex and loveable character which is really, really hard to achieve for a character that isn't the main protagonist. The main story in general is fantastic as usual, subtle details for the enthusiast, solid telling for the main stream gamer.You can easily spend 250 hours on this game and still have places unexplored.

The vanilla version of the game falls short for silly reasons while the modded version (Darth Mod is a true hero of our times) is awesome - easily one of the best strategy games made recently. So, in order to give the game a thorough review I'm going to look at what they did well, what they did (horribly) wrong and how the mod fixes it.What they did well: The AI is vastly improved especially on a strategy level. The AI now forms lasting alliances and looks to expand in a sensible way. It also builds armies quite well and tries to retain a useful balance of its forces (unlike previous TW-games where you could easily meet a full stack of archers because the AI thought it was a great unit and hey... you can't get enough of a good thing, right?). The economic system is much harder now and you can support fewer full stack armies which is great as it forces you to think more on how best to deploy your resources. It also means that you can't abuse the blitz-krieg concept which just won the game in previous TW games. You don't have enough armies to simply overwhelm any enemy in a year anymore and once you do, he has enough to defend against it. You have to build good armies, keep them alive and choose your battles carefully. Winning large battles quite literally determines the fate of empires.What they did wrong: Unfortunately, none of the good things mentioned above matter because of what they did wrong. On hard level and above, the computer cheats violently. It respawns full stack armies and earns bundles of money from nothing. Of course, that makes the game fairly difficult (and annoying) but more importantly, it removes all of those strategic elements the game got right. Winning on the filed means nothing now, no strategic value because he just spawns a new army. Only taking cities matters now. Blockading ports or otherwise hurting the AI through economy means nothing, he gets money for free. Diplomacy is useless because everyone automatically hates you now and they all have endless armies. Basically, this ruins the game. In the pure vanilla version this is no more than a 4/10 game.GO MOD! But luckily, the modding community comes to our aid. Darth Mod fixes all of those annoying points and even improves on the good ones (it's also easy to install). The AI is better on the field (you can actually lose now if you do something silly) and the world seems coherent and punishing. If you choose the wrong allies, you'll be in trouble, if you leave yourself exposed against a non-friendly neighbor, you'll be attacked, but at the same time you need to check the most rapidly expanding AIs or you'll find yourself in the world of Rob Stark: defeated without ever losing a battle. To win effectively on Hard level you have to use all aspects of the game; economy, diplomacy and tactics. Then it suddenly becomes a 10/10 game. However, since I can't give the game a top grade for work they didn't do themselves, I'll leave the rating on 7.",Magnethead

The game has so much potential, great ideas, nice naval battle addition and the whole idea of playing the gun line battles in the Total War engine is excellent. However, it all falls apart due to the controls of the game.Moving your gun lines around is just too tricky and illogical for the game to feel like anything but a struggle against the engine itself rather than against the enemy. Many areas of the maps don't allow for lines to be deployed evenly there and if you try, you get very strange formations with your soldiers often pointing in the wrong way or just taking forever to get into formation. At other times they'll just take the most ridiculous route to get into your new formation in your new location. Finally, sometimes they just bug out and either wander off the map completely or do nothing. The game compensates for this by making the AI ridiculously easy to beat. I've had many battles where I never felt like I was in control and that my plans came together and yet I'm rewarded with a heroic victory time and again. And this is on Very Hard difficulty, mind you.Darthmod helps a bit with some of the most annoying errors but not nearly enough.

It does so unapologetically and accurately while also bringing enough new ideas to the table to make the game more than pure nostalgia for nostalgia's sake. The underlying story and fantasy world are meticulously crafted, innovative and well written. Overall, the game is hugely successful though there still are minor issues that could be improved.PoE doesn't rely on the old D&D rules, they have their own, new RPG rule set that does use classes, spells, resting and the typical party roles we're used to (tank, healer, crowd control, damage) but otherwise has its own ideas of stat-interaction and a few new class ideas. The overall concepts will be recognizable to seasoned RPG veterans while still presenting new challenges to adapt to.The story is a major selling point of PoE. The writing is solid, the story deep and the character (especially the eight NPCs) are very well crafted. There's a great deal of freedom in regards to how you approach different quests and even characters in the game, you have almost unconstrained freedom to murder and pillage almost any character in the game, if you so choose, for example. A criticism here could be that perhaps the story doesn't escalate tension particularly well so that when the game ends, it doesn't feel so much like a strong climax as simply a steady unraveling of an intricate plot. The game behaves mostly like the final fight is a formality and the actually interesting question isn't if you win, but what you do after you win. This can make the game seem slightly less memorable than perhaps it should be.Arguably, there are some issues with balance that should be addressed too. Between DPS and non-DPS classes, the game becomes very fixed in its roles. Tanks find it hard dealing meaningful damage but retain the ability to tie down enemies through the game's 'engagement' system. This system simply means that if you run away from a character engaging you, that character damages you for free - however since tanks don't do meaningful damage, the AI could actually just run right past them with great advantage. It doesn't do that, luckily, but this lopsidedness arguably makes the game system feel a bit artificial at times. The spell system could also use a bit of rebalancing, certain spells serve no clear purpose in the game as you don't really have the time or the situations where they need to be cast. In most situations, dealing damage outweighs more complicated options. This said, the system actually works really well, it has genuinely intuitive ideas and I hope they continue to work on it.All in all, PoE is a successful RPG game and follows Divinity Original Sin in reviving this wonderful genre. The crowd-funding concept definitely worked in this instance. I hope Obsidian stick to this project and release a sequel soon, they needs only address a few issues that exist still in PoE and build on the promising world behind the game.",Magnethead

The problem lies only in two elements:1. Difficulty settings.2. Random Number Generators.Let it be said, if you're fairly casual with strategy and you play this game casually on ""normal"" setting, the game is absolutely fine. No problems there. This review is not for you then, just ignore. That's just not for me.If you're very serious about strategy, you'll almost certainly find ""Normal"" difficulty too easy and ""Classic"" fitting in general (at least if you're only planning one playthrough). Sounds great, right? Could have been except for one thing: the variance on Classic. Everything is a roll of the dice, which is fine, but the variance is insane. You can do everything right and still lose the game in one brief moment of bad luck. I'll illustrate the problem with this one scenario that actually took place for me:Turn 1. Your squad arrives in the woods. You move them into defensive positions just in case you're being charged right off the bat. They're all in cover, they're all in Overwatch (guarding). Three aliens attack, the squad takes down the first one. The second one uses a skill that automatically deals 1 damage, it hits one guy.*BREAK* Let me here say that one damage is nothing, it really is nothing.So, the guy who got hit with the whopping 1 damage rolls a dice and panics. He panics by turning to his right and trying to execute his friend standing right next to him because... well, who knows. It's the standard panic reaction in this game. He rolls another dice and misses from point blank range. Just can't hit. Well, fine you think, but alas. Behind him is a seasoned veteran, a captain who has seen many battles. He rolls a dice too, he also panics. Now, he has taken 0 damage, he has merely seen one dude take one damage. Well, he handles panic in the same way and decides to execute one of his friends. He chooses your best solider (and medic) and nails her right in the back of the head with a critical hit, killing her instantly. End turn one.Turn 2. Bring up menu, quit game.Things like this just happen, they just do. You can restart the mission whenever they do, but it wears you out. Or it did with me. Worst thing is, they could fix everything wrong with this game so easily.1. rebalance panic.2. remove critical hits.Just those two things would limit the variance to a degree where the game would feel hard but fair. It's really all they needed to do and then the game would probably be a 10.",Magnethead

It's most accurately compared to a game like Texas Hold'em Poker in the sense that it requires skill to play accurately, but in a lot of scenarios skill won't matter tremendously due to huge variance. This doesn't make Hearthstone a bad game, just a very casual game.My main objections are:1. The direction the game is taking - towards less diverse, simpler gameplay and deck-building. Steadily heading deeper into mediocrity.2. How extremely greedy the game is and that's where a new player needs to pay attention. If you want all the cards in Hearthstone, an average estimate of around 600$ is by no means exaggerated. If you want the cards for the current Standard format, you can maybe cut it down to around 450$. That's extreme and your expenses won't end there, you should expect something like 50$ a year at least from that point on. Now, you don't need all cards but if you want to have a few decent decks, you're probably still looking at 150-200$.Hearthstone is suited for people who'd like a very casual card-game to have a bit of fun with and for whom money isn't really an object. If you liked Magic the Gathering or strategical games in general, you'd be better off looking at games like Faeria or Hex or something like that (or Magic the Gathering Online if a clunky interface doesn't bother you).In the end, Hearthstone remains a mediocre game because of its insistent pandering to the absolutely lowest denominator and its terrible greed, but the game isn't bad as such.

Humorous, colourful, varied and sometimes outright dark, it comes together nicely in the end. Lots of little details to explore and combat is very rarely repetitive. It revolves a lot around the four elements and how they interact mixed with some crowd-controlling abilities, buffs and debuffs from other lines (do NOT ignore these if you play on a difficult setting!). The only problem I encountered was that I often mess around with different classes and ideas on a difficult setting while I learn the game mechanics well enough to create my exact party concept. In this game, there is a bit of a lull early on in the game with a lot of story-driven gameplay which can be a bit tedious to replay seven times before you get the party balance right.

The voice acting is bad, the story offers no immersion and doesn't spark any desire to explore or interact.

The game is around 10 hours long which is perfect length for a game like this that doesn't have sandbox worlds to explore or character creation and levelling to establish an evolving gameplay experience - the mechanics you start out with are more or less the same you end up with.The incredible story and talent of the protagonist are what will carry you through this game and stay with you long after it's done. There really isn't enough good things to say about Senua as a character or indeed about how she's acted. She feels real and intense without losing credibility as a fierce warrior, her mental... issues are credible, unpleasant and sometimes eerie to play through. She's equally easy to sympathise with and admire.The gameplay mechanics in Senua's Sacrifice revolves around simple but solid mechanics shifting from spacial puzzles to melee combat and back many times. The combat, while not amongst the most challenging of its kind, feels natural and flows well. It won't challenge a seasoned Witcher or Dark Souls veteran but it works well enough to not feel stale. The puzzles, as puzzles tend to do, can frustrate you if you missed some minor detail somewhere and get stuck but they're never unreasonable and the game helps you along very nicely if only you listen to all of the helpful (sometimes...) voices at your disposal.However, the narrative is the jewel in this game accompanied by stunning visual arts and a terrific soundtrack. Senua is probably the best female hero-protagonist we've ever seen in gaming so far. She's got a simple, bold ambition - to save the boy she loved - and she travels to Hel to do it. As with many such titles, the game explores her personal history and background along the way and she faces externalised version of inner demons as tends to be the case in such stories, but she does it with tenacity, audacity and without compromise. When you control Senua, she feels vulnerable and powerful at the same time and it's easy to want to help her, not only out of sympathy but because she's inspiring and strong.The Norse/Celtic setting works well enough - the Norse legends are recognisable to a Scandinavian and the world has a credible harsh and desolate feel.All in all, Senua's Sacrifice doesn't try to do anything no one arguably hasn't done before, it just does it more beautifully, with superior acting and visuals. Where many narrative-focused games have drifted away from the film elements to a more minimalist, simplistic aesthetic, Senua's Sacrifice uses all the modern tools of visual storytelling to tell a memorable and inspired story.",Magnethead

Your fellow characters have real depth and so does your primary protagonist and the city itself. The world is dirty, corrupt, greedy, harsh, sad, all the things the world of Ellroy needs to be and it pulls no punches. There are no heroes here but that doesn't mean they're all villains either.

Sometimes the game and the player will misunderstand each other which will lead to the player quitting and replaying a segment and feeling annoyed because he expected a different outcome from an action than the game presented and the player had no way of anticipating this. It isn't always exactly clear what the consequences will be from selecting a specific dialogue but most of the time it works. The facial animation can still seem slightly outdated (or very) but you can recognize the actors and the acting itself is top notch.Do not buy this game if you're looking for a new GTA, do not buy if you don't like stories and want action. But if you like stories, noire literature/film, Ellroy, just trying something a bit new to gaming, you HAVE to play this game. Very rewarding, extremely well done. This game was cared for down to its smallest detail, I hope we see more like this.",Magnethead

I assume that if you're looking at Dragon Age II, you've already played Dragon Age: Origins so that's my angle in this review. Two things characterized Origins and I'll compare those to DAII.Tactical gameplay:Almost doesn't exist anymore which is surprising because seemingly the skills are much the same for the different classes but the combat is so fast and damage based (and the removal of friendly fire on all difficulty setting except Nightmare) that the game doesn't feel tactical and complicated at all. Instead you just end up running your own character around right-clicking everything. Combat is a lot less interesting and much more repetitive. The great thing in Origins was building the party, preparing the tactic and executing it. Forget about all that here and just send the tank forward and start AOEing on him.Story and Character depth:Not even close to Origins. The story in Origins might have been slightly stereotypical but it had depth of character. Not here. Perhaps the idea behind the more fast paced combat was to focus more on the story-telling but it fails miserably. They're hurrying emotional moments, killing off characters you've just met with violins going crazy in the background. It feels like it was written by Stephany Meyer rather than anyone on the Bioware staff of old. Dialogue seems forced and trite and lines are overloaded with information they try to squeeze into way to few lines and too little time. People will literally say things like ""Just because you make captain in the first year of service doesn't mean that you can bla bla bla"". They want the silver tattooed elf (not actually tattoos but never mind) to blow your mind just by his cool stance leaning on a wall and sounding tough. You spend too much time talking to people who should have been a part of Vampire Diaries.All in all, this game fails on all levels except the immediate, graphical impression. Reused areas (to the extent where it gets embarrassing), weak story line and dialogue  and shallow gameplay. If you liked Origins, you're likely to hate this.",Magnethead

260757,Shadowrun: Hong Kong,PC,7,"SRHK is the best written game in the series so far; unfortunately, the mechanics and balance aren't as solid. I recommend this game because of the storyline, the feel of the Shadowrun universe, not for its ability to challenge a turn-based strategy enthusiast.The story is altogether well done; several layers, good NPCs, enough space to define your own character through dialogues andSRHK is the best written game in the series so far; unfortunately, the mechanics and balance aren't as solid. I recommend this game because of the storyline, the feel of the Shadowrun universe, not for its ability to challenge a turn-based strategy enthusiast.The story is altogether well done; several layers, good NPCs, enough space to define your own character through dialogues and actions. It takes it time, offers background information if you're interested, and if you paid attention to what's been said, it even has a real influence on the ending of the game. That part of the game is a clear 10/10.The problem is the game mechanics balance; new (or altered) mechanics fail and the game ends up being a roflstomp fest for the player as it nears the end (or it should at least). Some newly introduced mechanics, like the bionic arm that throws all grenades back at the attacker, are completely unbalanced and much too strong. The devs attempted to make decking/the matrix more stealthy too, and while that is an admirable idea, I don't think they succeeded. The player runs between sniffers and if you get caught by one, the trick is to take it down fast. It means you can almost completely bypass decking skills and still succeed in the Matrix which is a bit of a shame. I'm not sure how the Matrix should be represented visually or how it should work through game mechanics but I'm pretty sure this wasn't the answer. Matrix program summoning still doesn't really matter and there still isn't the feel that you're actually hacking anything - it still feels mostly like a mini-game that is eerily similar to a simplified version of regular combat.The most predominant problems is, however, that the AI seems broken at times. It handles melee combat units terribly - the enemy units often simply move around between cover and never attack anything, and if you get a melee unit close to one of the AI units, they often spend their entire turn just running around, never attacking anything either. Actually, as you near the end of the game, the AI will surprisingly often spend its turn doing absolutely nothing. Needless to say, that makes winning a combat encounter relatively easy.One feature that worked (and I'm not completely sure it's new but I think it is) is that you can now choose to enter turn-based combat mode if you see an enemy on screen, even if combat isn't initialized. This allows you to move into position and plan your attack if you have the element of surprise. That's a nice feature that I'd like to see used more in the future.In the end, this game isn't bad. It's got nice ambiance, good storytelling and great characters. You just can't have a top quality game if your basic mechanics don't function.",Magnethead

The visuals are terrific with all the old school, Alien style tech and industrial feel of everything. That carries the game a long way. The story, the background, all of that is excellent.This game could well have been a clear ten if not for a very few things:Only two things wrong, really. One is that the game is a bit too linear. You lack the tool for door x, you know you'll come back to door x once you get that tool. Sometimes you can explore other areas and you'll be rewarded with loot (important for survival) but most of the time you follow a path. Sometimes takes a bit out of the exploration. Two is that the game over-extends slightly near the end. It should have stopped a bit before it does. One or two too many twists and turns and in the end you just want to get it over with which is a shame but doesn't severely damage the overall impression of having played an excellent game.",Magnethead

For starters, the fighting is undeniably repetitive, including both the style in which you have to take down goons, and the goons themselves. The graphics are very good, but lacks variety completely. Most of the game takes place in dark, grayish corridors and rooms, with little visual impact once you've grown accustomed to the realism. Gotham City sits in the background ready to be explored, but is left out of the game completely. The game also introduces you to the Batmobile from the very start, but never incorporates it into the game except for videos. There are multiple bosses that you don't even fight; Harley Quinn is a main character throughout much of the game, yet you don't even fight her. You simply kill a bunch of the same goons as always, and a video then catches her and locks her up for you. Overall, I've still enjoyed playing the game, but with a Metacritic score of 92 out of 100, you would expect scenery variety and combat that rivals games like God of War, and the exploration of a game like Tomb Raider. It just doesn't live up to the hype it's generated, although hardcore Batman fans should still make it a must-play. 75 out of 100 for me.",DanielD.

As with the previous reviews, the game seems too easy and too short, making the game seem like an interactive movie rather than a full-fledged adventure game. In some cases, in order to die, a player has to force him or herself to. The enemy AI in the game is rather weaktight and not very strategic, and the animals are surprisingly harder to kill than the humans. While the game has improved on Lara's ability (ability to jump from ledge to ledge while hanging, various martial arts stunts), it has also decreased it from the last editions (Lara holds her breath for approximately 30 seconds instead of 60, she can no longer sprint). The graphics are appealing, but nowhere near as advanced as they can possibly be (case in point, Halflife 2) without pushing the computer beyond its structural limitations via next-gen mode. The game also follows a linear plot, resulting in an unwanted ""To be continued"" ending, unlike the previous games which each had their own storyline. (A Tomb Raider Legend II would cause a lot of problems in the system) However, the positive issues about the game that save it from a flop is the intriguing storyline itself, and how it connects Lara's past to her present. The architecture in the levels are superb and show that a lot of effort has gone into the design of these levels. The movements of Lara are fluid, and her emotions and reactions are penultimately realistic than they were in the previous Core Design series. If Crystal Dynamics intends to make a sequel, a skill-building system should be placed in to make the game even more realistic and appealing to the public. In short, the game is hopefully a foreshadowing of the next improvement in the Tomb Raider product line.",SamuelL.

117579,L.A.

Noire lo Ã¨ fin da subito per intero), la visuale libera in terza persona, la possibilitÃ  di guidare macchine e muoversi a piedi, missioniFacciamo subito un po' di chiarezza sulle caratteristiche, siamo di fronte ad un gioco che nelle basi condivide la struttura delle due precedenti produzioni Rockstar, intese come una mappa liberamente esplorabile (anzi, in L.A. Noire lo Ã¨ fin da subito per intero), la visuale libera in terza persona, la possibilitÃ  di guidare macchine e muoversi a piedi, missioni primarie, secondarie e collezionabili di ogni sorta. Appurato questo, sono il ""cuore"" della produzione e il fluire del gameplay a donare quella freschezza e personalitÃ  necessarie per emergere da quei due mostri sacri che inevitabilmente sono stati utilizzati dagli utenti come confronto durante il corso dei mesi. La prima differenza piÃ¹ visibile e scontata Ã¨ rappresentata dall'ambientazione: siamo nella Los Angeles di fine anni 40', dove i grattacieli di Downtown non avevano ancora preso il sopravvento e invece Sunset Boulevard non era cosÃ¬ distante da quella dei giorni nostri. Una Los Angeles ancora piÃ¹ mitica, che dopo la seconda guerra mondiale cominciava a mostrare al mondo intero la potenza della sua macchina cinematografica e del vivere sempre al massimo. Ma anche una Los Angeles dominata da un malaffare creato dai veterani tornati dalla guerra, dal racket delle scommesse, dalla droga, da incendi dolosi e da serial killer che si divertono a prendere in giro la polizia investigativa. In questo scenario il vostro alter ego Ã¨ Cole Phelps, ex marine che al ritorno in patria entra a far parte della polizia come investigatore, secondo un filo conduttore che lo porterÃ  poi a fare carriera nella omicidi, narcotici (chiamata anche Vice) e cosÃ¬ via.Nessuno spazio alla componente multigiocatore, L.A. Noire per quanto disponga di molte delle caratteristiche proprie dei free roam predilige un approccio del giocatore piÃ¹ lineare, dove girovagare per la cittÃ  diventa piÃ¹ un piacere visivo che altro, magari addirittura dopo aver terminato le vicende principali. Vi Ã¨ infatti una apposita opzione denominata free roam che risulta utile per completare la raccolta di collezionabili oppure le missioni secondarie. La narrazione si sviluppa secondo tre piani paralleli, quello principale prevede la risoluzione di ventuno casi investigativi incentrati sulle problematiche esplicate poche righe piÃ¹ sopra, secondo un filo logico che inizialmente sembra essere scollegato nelle sue parti, ma che in seguito porta alla luce connessioni sempre maggiori tra i personaggi e i crimini nei quali si imbatte Phelps.Tra ogni caso e il successivo ci sono dei flashback non interattivi legati al periodo precedente a quello vissuto direttamente (la guerra ad Okinawa del 45' soprattutto) mentre durante lo svolgimento dei casi Ã¨ possibile raccogliere dei giornali grazie ai quali lanciare brevi filmati che arricchiscono la storia principale e che mostrano le vicende di personaggi coinvolti in qualche modo con il protagonista principale. Qualcuno si starÃ  sicuramente chiedendo se Ã¨ possibile entrare negli edifici a proprio piacimento. La risposta Ã¨ ni, nel senso che la maggior parte delle volte si puÃ² solamente se sono funzionali alla missione in corso; esistono ad ogni modo dei luoghi famosi che sono accessibili anche in altre occasioni ma che comunque hanno poco da offrire se non dal punto di vista puramente visivo. Eccoci al gameplay dunque, Cole Phelps si controlla come ci si aspetterebbe, il movimento demandato allo stick analogico sinistro, telecamera a quello destro e cosÃ¬ via. La stessa cosa vale per le sezioni in macchina e le sparatorie, che condividono il sistema di copertura ""fisso"" come quello di Mafia 2 e in maniera standard per il genere. Sia ben chiaro perÃ², la componente di azione in L.A Noire non Ã¨ affatto quella principale, ma Ã¨ anzi Ã¨ relativa soprattutto alle missioni secondarie, che mai come in questo caso possono essere utilizzate per spezzare la storia e il tipo di gameplay che il gioco ha da offrire per la maggior parte del tempo. Il loro accesso Ã¨ semplice, quando si Ã¨ alla guida di una macchina della polizia puÃ² capitare in maniera casuale di ricevere una chiamata, la si accetta con il tasto A e immediatamente appare la posizione da raggiungere sulla mappa.Le missioni secondarie prevedono ad esempio sparatorie dopo un assalto in banca, inseguimenti in auto oppure a piedi, in strada o per palazzi, la cosa carina perÃ² Ã¨ rappresentata dal fatto che queste quaranta missioni hanno nome proprio e un minimo di diversificazione sempre e comunque, a testimonianza che il Team Bondi ha cercato di rendere il titolo il piÃ¹ credibile possibile e legato ad un impianto narrativo.Tutto sommato, un vero capolavoro da non perdere.",Dario97
159306,Call of Duty: Black Ops,Xbox360,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Call of Duty: Black Ops Ã¨ il settimo di questa meravigliosa saga.E' uno sparatutto in prima persona che affronta questo genere in modo affascinante, infatti Ã¨ stato dichiarato ufficialmente il migliore sparatutto del 2010 ed Ã¨ ancora oggi tra i migliori, con tanti milioni di copie vendute, perÃ² i rivali non mancano.Parlando del gioco non posso evitare di dire che Ã¨ un capolavoro, ma a causa del cambiamento della casa produttrice c'Ã¨ stato qualche disapprovazione su questo titolo.Quasi tutti i capitoli della saga sono stati fatti dalla Treyarch; ma noi ricordiamo bene il predecessore di Black Ops, ovvero Modern Warfare, esso Ã¨ stato creato dalla Infinity Ward, ciÃ² ha creato rivalitÃ  tra le due case produttrici e quindi l'ultimo numero della saga non Ã¨ stato molto apprezzato a causa di ciÃ².Voi vi chiederete come mai siamo passati alla Infinity Ward e successivamente di nuovo alla Treyarch?Tutti i Fan della saga lo sanno; La Infinity Ward ha voluto partecipare in Call of Duty facendo un buon affare con l'Activision, ma voleva modificarne il titolo chiamando il videogioco solo Modern Warfare, nonostante ciÃ² il ''Call of Duty'' Ã¨ rimasto, cosÃ¬ c'Ã¨ stato un litigio tra perchÃ¨ doveva starci solo una collaborazione della Infinity Ward che voleva andare oltre; cosÃ¬ poi Ã¨ ritornata la Treyarch ma noi videogiocatori sappiamo che Ã¨ migliore la Infinity Ward Ã¨ quindi c'Ã¨ stato questo calo di approvazione nell uscita di Black Ops.Ma ora parliamo del gioco in se per se.Call of Duty: Black Ops parla in parte della seconda guerra mondiale, ma ne troviamo una sola missione, il resto si ambienta dopo, ed Ã¨ del tutto una Guerra Fredda.Durante la Storia dovrai fermare in parte vari nemici intenti ad usare il Gas Nova, un gas capace di uccidere migliaia di persone.Il protagonista, ''Mason'' viene interrogato per tutta la campagna del gioco, infatti le missioni sono ciÃ² che lui si ricorda e quindi immaginarie, dei pensieri dove non tutto Ã¨ reale.Durante la campagna avrai degli amici che ti saranno molto fondamentale e di aiuto per sconfiggere l'Unione Sovietica passando poi ai nemici principali del gioco che si uccidono mano a mano si percorre quest'avventura di ben 15 missioni con una longevitÃ  che varia tra le 6 e le 8 ore, anche in base alla difficolta che come nei normali sparatutto Ã¨ suddivisa in quattro: Recluta, Soldato, Esperto e Veterano.L'interrogazione su Mason Ã¨ causata dal fatto che dentro la tua testa c'Ã¨ qualcosa di importante.Infatti vieni scambiato inizialmente per infiltrato ma a volte anche per uno di loro, intento a collaborare con i nemici , tutto ciÃ² si capisce poi alla fine della campagna.Parte molto fondamentale della storia Ã¨ un'amico che conoscerai a Vorkuta, una ''prigione'' dove sei stato rinchiuso.Esso ti accompagnerÃ  per gran parte di questa avventura.Dovrai viaggiare tra Vietnam e Cuba, dove affronterai molti nemici e trovare l'obiettivo della missione, ma non sempre sarÃ  possibile a causa del buono intelleto o meglio della buona furbizia dei nemici.Affrontarli non sarÃ  semplice, infatti bisognerÃ  contare molto sull'aiuto dei tuoi amici, ma saranno loro ad appoggiarsi su di te.Ritornando a prima, da Vorkuta dovrai fuggire con la collaborazione del tuo nuovo amico di nome Reznov; sarÃ  grazie a lui se ti salverai la pelle, ma non il cervello, ciÃ² perchÃ¨ durante l'interrogatorio il protagonista difficilmente si ricorderÃ  tutto nei minimi dettagli.Ti immergerai, e dico ''immergerai'', anche in missioni Stealth, ma ciÃ² non vuol dire che ci dovrai annegare.Di luoghi ne vedrai passando da case e cittÃ , a fiumi, villaggi e boschi ma non mancherÃ  la neve e quindi le montagne.Il tutto con un'eccellente cinematografia che ti farÃ  in alcuni casi immedesimare in Mason.Come abbiamo accennato all'inizio, una missione Ã¨ ambientata nella seconda guerra mondiale, lÃ¬ non sarai Mason ma bensÃ¬ Reznov, esso Ã¨ stato a raccontarti cio che avviene poi nella missione.Esso, Reznov fu un infiltrato che collaborÃ² nella ricerca del Gas Nova.Il protagonista, Mason, non ne potrÃ  farne almeno di pensare a Reznov, e quÃ¬ che io non posso aggiungere altro.Molto affascinanti sono le missioni ambientate in Vietnam, e non mancherÃ  il pilotaggio di alcuni veicoli per breve tempo, in particolare l'Hind, un velivolo.La fine della Trama avviene alla fine dell'interrogatorio, perchÃ¨ l'interrogatorio finisce e quindi dopo che Mason capisce dove trovare la base nemica intenta a fare una strage, dovrai andarci e impedire che ciÃ² avvenga, lÃ¬ finira questa avvincente storia ma non accenno se con un lieto fine o viceversa; toccherÃ  a voi scoprire tutto durante la campagna quando ci giocherete.Le missioni non sono mai uguali e mantengono un certo tipo di cinematografia che renderÃ  sempre piÃ¹ spettacolare la campagna, anche i disastri e le tragedie non mancano.",Dario97
76485,Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,PC,9,"As a long standing Metal Gear fan I was as excited as teen is with their first car for this game. Kojima usually never fails to please when it comes to games for me. I have grown up with these games for most of my life and I sometimes feel like I know the characters more then they know themselves. And while Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has the honor of being my favorite game of all timeAs a long standing Metal Gear fan I was as excited as teen is with their first car for this game. Kojima usually never fails to please when it comes to games for me. I have grown up with these games for most of my life and I sometimes feel like I know the characters more then they know themselves. And while Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has the honor of being my favorite game of all time Metal Gear Solid 5 does have a place in my heart forever as well. I feel however it could have been so much more had they let Kojima make the game he wanted to make and actually would have let him finish the ending he had wanted to finish. The game is amazingly fun gameplay wise. It mixes elements of sandbox, rpg, and stealth perfectly. The game also plays alot like mgs3 in certain aspects. The main downfall this game has is in two aspects. The first one is snakes voice actor. Now David Hayter  may not be a good voice actor but he is corny and over the top. He is also most importantly perfect for the voice of snake. I never thought anyone else could voice snake and be good at it. And I was right. There's a reason Kiefer Sutherland doesn't talk much in the game and that's because he's a terrible voice actor. Snake stays silent for most of the game and that's because the voice actor portraying him is mediocre. Now I'm fine with bad voice acting in a game as long as its the first game in a series. But when it's your fifth game if you're going to start making adjustments please make sure you get good voice actors. Big Boss was never not talkative in MGS3 or Peacewalker. Did he talk less then solid snake? Sure but was he practically silent the whole game having no emotion at all? No and that's where this Metal gear falls short.  The rest of the voice acting crew all sound really good and then Kiefer comes in with his terrible voice acting. The second part it falls short in is the story. The story is pretty good up until the end. Now i'm not going to spoil it for you but think mass effect threes ending in the sense it kind of makes the whole game null but not as bad. This stuff isn't enough to make the game an absolute failure though. The game is absolutely one of the best of 2015 and one of the best Metal Gears of all time.",albertc

Now Lets get the 8/10 rating out of the way first. The original N64 game is by far the best N64 game of all time in my opinion; let alone one of the greatest games of all time. It is definitely within my personal top 5 games of all time, it is a 10/10 masterpiece of a game. However the amount of things they've changed in this game  has done enough to bump it down to an 8/10. This game is still a fantastic game but let's go over some of the changes I feel are either unnecessary or just bad in general. One of these such changes is butting the Clocktown bank in the clock tower. This change makes it so the banks usual position in west Clocktown and places it in the south Clocktown clock tower. This change is absolutely unnecessary as all it does is change the location, it makes it slightly easier for newer players to get to as well. The next change is having the double song of time transport you to any time of the day. This change doesn't bother me a lot but it does end up making things a lot easier for new players. Another change, which is by far the worst change. Is the fact that every single dungeon boss has an eye on them somewhere which is their weak point. This means that the bosses are painfully easy to a Zelda Veteran like me and makes it easier for new players. You see where I'm going with this? The game has been toned down an awful lot so that it is easier for people new to the series. Not only that but a lot of these changes wouldn't even help a new player that much. (well except for the eye on every boss thing.) One of the things that I've always loved about the Zelda franchise is that the games were never hard, but they were challenging. They force you to think outside the box and use items that seem pointless at first but turn out to be crucial. my other favorite thing is the adventure. The feeling that you are in a living breathing world that continues to go on even when you aren't in it. I feel very few games capture this feeling better then the Zelda games. And while the 3DS version of Majoras mask does screw up on some very minor things. It improves on all the major things. The graphics make the game look absolutely amazing compared to what it used to be. The game has remastered audio which sounds absolutely amazing. The Puzzles in the dungeons always seem fresh and new. The game which I grew up loving and cherishing is still very much there. This game is perfect if you want Majoras Mask on mobile and even better if you are new to Zelda and want to give the games a try. Overall I recommend it to everyone.",albertc

(Well I love The Civilization games but they don't have a heavy combat focus.) I happen to be on one of those people that heard of fire emblem when super smash brothers brawl came out and contained Marth and Ike. I knew the games existed but never gave them much thought because I never liked strategy games.   Then when the Fire Emblem new 3DS XL came out. I needed a new 3DS as my launch day system was starting to fail. So I purchased the new 3DS XL Fire Emblem edition and bought Birthright with the branching conquest DLC added to it. After finishing both the Birthright and Conquest story lines I can say that I now have a love for strategy games (Or at the very least Fire Emblem.) The story is of two kingdoms (The Hoshidans and the Nohrs) that are in the middle of a war with each other. In the middle of this whole conflict is a kid by the name of Corrin  who was raised by the Nohr's. As The story Progresses we learn more and more about this kid and it turns out that (WARNING: small spoiler alert ahead.) he was born as a Hoshidan but was taken away from his family at a very young age. He then has to face a choice. If you bought Birthright with the Conquest DLC then you can make the choice of going back to the family that raised you and Conquering the world with the Nohr's, or you can stay with your biological family. This is actually a very important part of the game as it changes which characters will fight with you, as well as the story.  The Gameplay is that of a strategy game. You have units and so does your enemy. Your job is to kill all the enemies units. There are certain classes that your units can fall into. There are plenty of them so I suggest that you look them up. The soundtrack is probably the weakest part of this game. There is a song sang throughout the game multiple times which I am almost sure was originally in Japanese because the lyrics never sound quite right in English. There is also quite a bit of Character development. This game is easily my second favorite 3DS game and I feel like I could keep playing it over and over again.

First off let me say I have not got this excited over a game in a very long time. I even did the early release at gamestop pickup party which I never go to. Got this baby home ready to rock that gryphons face from the review video we all watched. This is where it goes down hill fast. I can immediately see that graphics are not the same as in the review video even though it was suppose to be Ps4. The foliage in this game is horrid from more then two feet away. Many forums have already sprouted up making claims that they for sure downgraded the graphics from what we saw in the review videos. Oh and clipping.... yea this game has a ton of that. All armor doesn't interact right. The shirts are constantly clipping through the pants. Its some serious Ps2 stuff going on. Oh also all these positive comments about the wind looking amazing. What????? The physics are sooo off how can anyone say that. Every single blade of grass up to giant tree looks like its being blown in different direction then the one right next to it. Also ive noticed alot of hanging plants when I walk into them just disappear until you adjust camera angle rather then moving. Now about the controls. How on earth did they manage to get the horrid laggy type controls from odd world abes odyssey. Seriously its that bad. I had to spend many minutes adjusting my sensitivity and it still feels off. The game on hardest difficulty has been a breeze through what I have seen so far. There are just so many things wrong with this it isn't really possible to list them all. There are many youtube video already showing up that verify everything I am speaking about and more. They did not give us the game they showed us that is for sure.,Arthainius

All the boss encounters have been fun and manageable. Graphics maxed out look really good especially with the unique textures they use. There were a few surprising parts in the story as well.

The first big problem I have is this is not a Batman game anymore with how much you are forced to use bat-mobile for main mission line. There is no doubt that its well designed but its just too forced. The second big problem I have is the actual story itself. There is no doubt its pretty good as far as twist and turns but the ending(s) were pretty weak in comparison. Seemed like they didn't know how to finish the story then failed at trying 3 times.Batman combat was pretty slick. Has almost the Arkham City feel just somehow not as fluid. I cant tell if there are just too many enemy types now or if they intentionally slowed it down. Seems like I was a much better fighter in Arkham City. I completed main story on hard mode in about 14 hours at a casual pace. I will say this game made me jump a couple times which I LOVED.It looks really good however the rain definitely looks a bit off. Somehow GTA5 has way better looking rain. I think its the lighting style. Also it doesn't look very real as your driving fast.,Arthainius

First the gun play is amazing. The shooting feels so much more crisp then the last two fallout games. Second would have to be for me the new VATS system. It feels more realistic maintaining live action but with it slowed down it still gives you time to scan your surroundings for best way to approach the rest of your encounter. There is also fun builds focusing on VATS. Third would have to be the new settlements. This is a fun addition to the game that you can spend many hours on. It also makes sense that as the savior of the wasteland you would build settlements for people to live in safely.Okay as far as the bad I will admit the graphics look dated but Bethesda is giving us mods which will surly include texture packs. Another big issue is they got rid of Reputation and Karma... these were vital in maintaining responsibility in actions. If you travel alone especially you will notice no negative effects for stealing at all unless your caught which of course if your getting caught stealing your playing wrong.If they mod in or patch in some improved textures and the addition of karma with town reps the game will be near perfect.,Arthainius

In this, I am disappointed in Ken Levine. He started some of the most seminal works in gaming, including the Thief games, System Shock 2, and Bioshock. Now Bioshock 1 was already a ""step back"" from System Shock 2.

But really, 1999 mode is just a difficulty setting, that's all it is.If you haven't played or been exposed to as many classics as I have, then I'm sure this will live up to the hype for you.

But when you give people with no experience in level creation the tools and audience to do so, it turns out they squander that opportunity.You can create your own Mario levels, share them with friends, and play other people's levels, but once you realize the levels people upload range from gimmicky ""don't move and watch all the crazy things that almost kill you in this on-rails level,"" to ""look at how insanely difficult this level is because I love Kaizo Mario"" and ""I'm 11 and what is game design,"" you quickly start to feel some buyer's remorse.It's reminiscent of Little Big Planet, where anyone could make levels, but most people make terrible levels. When you make a game where the ONLY thing you can do (besides create your own stages) is play other people's generally lackluster levels.The game controls great, there's multiple game styles you can choose from that actually give you different abilities (original Mario is basic, Super Mario World has spin jumps, New Super Mario Bros has wall-jumping, etc) but when the game's only attempt at a single-player is ""try to beat 10 random user-created levels and be rewarded with literally nothing,"" then you get a game that's basically a really cool gimmick that delivers no extrinsic rewards.There are TONS of cool, interestingly-made levels, but they're absolutely drowned out by the onslaught of terribly made joke levels where you hit a coin block and a bunch of confetti and annoying sound effects pop out, as well as a slew of levels designed to be so hard that you might have found a new fetish by the time you manage to beat it.",ChaseFace

If you've always wanted the universe of Final Fantasy to be a multiplayer adventure, this is your answer. That being said, it's not a perfect MMO from a mechanics standpoint, but it feels like if World of Warcraft was friendlier and more majestic.Square Enix keeps adding new content every 2 months so there's never a lack of things to accomplish. There's 8 crafting classes, 3 gathering classes, and 9 combat classes, and they're adding more combat classes in the future.The combat, GUI, game mechanics, crafting, gathering, etc. are all explained simply to you through the main storyline, which doubles as a tutorial with a very manageable learning curve.The end-game can be either really close-knit and supportive or highly competitive with neckbeards trolling over the shout channel and prove how leet they are with their top-tier gear. I suspect they migrated from World of Warcraft.But don't worry, the game offers a LOT of challenge. The Primals (Garuda, Ifrit, Titan, Siren, Odin and now Leviathan) have 3 difficulties - Normal, which you complete to progress the storyline, Hard, which you complete to get your Relic Weapon as well as get Primal Weapon drops, and Extreme, which you complete for high-level quests (I would assume, I'm still trying to beat Titan HM). Hard Mode is already pretty hard.If you happen to be a big fan of RUSHING through the game to get to the end-game content, you're gonna be a little disappointed. There's a good amount to do end-game, but since the game's only 6 months old they're still releasing new content. Take your time and smell the roses.ALSO, THE ONLY REASON THIS GAME HAS SO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS IS BECAUSE THE LAUNCH WAS REALLY CHAOTIC AND PEOPLE COULDN'T LOGIN OR CREATE NEW CHARACTERS (y'know, like most MMOs experience when they receive a massive amount of traffic) SO EVERYONE **** AND MOANED EVERYWHERE ON THE INTERNET.

Seriously...who paid off who for those reviews? You can see the discrepancy when you look at critical reviews vs. actual gamer reviews. I think a lot of people aren't going to look at the GTA series the same way. I hope Rockstar listens and doesn't believe it's own hype for the next one. It was worth a 7 not a 10.",Jim

48834,Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty,PC,8," I loved the original Starcraft, but seriously, fanboi hat off for this. Yes, it's an amazing game. Graphics are very good, system reqs reasonable, cinematics are incredible, multiplayer was beta tested to death (and boy does it show with the amazing balance of gameplay), and the Terran campaign is decent.

Graphics are very good, system reqs reasonable, cinematics are incredible, multiplayer was beta tested to death (and boy does it show with the amazing balance of gameplay), and the Terran campaign is decent. It's more than just a new coat of paint on the old game, but you can see though that the gameplay is evolutionary of the original game, not revolutionary. Blizzard had to do this so the game would find instant favour with the legions of Starcraft 1 fans. However, you just know that Blizzard held back Protoss and Zerg campaigns so they can wring more cash out of people buying this game. And you can be guaranteed that those 'expansions' will contain new branches to the existing tech trees for multiplayer, so you will have to buy them, even if you're not interested in the campaigns. Let's face it, multiplayer is the core of this game - but no LAN play is a slap in the face, forcing you onto Battle.net. An obvious ploy to deter piracy at the expense of people who buy the game, and forcing people into their realm for buying their retarded horse DLC. You can be sure there will be a ""complete"" battle chest edition in the future, with all the content that should have been there from the start. Then if they add LAN play back in, this game would be a perfect 10.",Jim

Whilst I'm not a hardcore gamer I have seen the industry grow over three decades to become the leading entertainment phenomenon. I must confess to never having played a Grand Theft Auto game until this one as the premise of the previous games didn't appeal to me. I'm no liberal, it's just that they seemed to try to shock for publicity sake and to attract a particular male demographic and in all honesty I found them somewhat immature and puerile. Well haven't I now eaten humble pie! Whilst I wasn't caught up in the years long hype surrounding GTAV that gameplay trailer released a few months ago peaked my interest so I preordered it. After playing GTAV for nearly 30 hours I can say without even the slightest reservation that this is the greatest video game I have ever played. Period. It's open world is by far the most astonishing thing I've ever seen in a game. I cannot grasp how Rockstar have created such a vast world that is fully explorable with virtually no boundaries. It's crammed with such astonishing detail it blows my mind. I am hooked, totally. I never want it to end and it's reset the bar for what games can be. Every other game pales in comparison. It took the open world style perfected in Red Dead Redemption and thrust it into a contemporary Los Angeles with a satirical twist. There's just so much to do, or not to do as you can just live in the world if you so chose, playing golf, driving around in fast cars or any number of other pastimes. Some of the mini-games are as polished as other full games. It's also the greatest looking and sounding game I've ever seen. The environmental effects are sublime and I defy anyone to find a better looking game currently available. The most important aspect of any game is the actual gameplay mechanic itself and in this respect GTAV has it nailed. Driving, shooting, everything feels just right. This game is polished and reeks of quality craftsmanship. It's addictive beyond belief and the hours you put into it just fly by. The three main protagonists are all superbly realised, scripted and acted. Even the wildcard Trevor manages to be equal parts endearing and frighteningly repulsive. The games sense of humour is spot on from character dialogue to the myriad visual gags, there's a scathing wit running throughout the whole game and modern Americana is the prime target. Hats off to Rockstar, they've stolen the crown and have my highest admiration for their ability to push both the medium and current gen technology to new levels. My new favourite game of all time.",The_Seeker
61775,Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception,PlayStation3,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        The single player campaign is shorter than Uncharted 2 by some way but contains some utterly jaw dropping environments and set pieces. I was able to clock it in just over 10 hours but loved every minute of it. This is graphically, one of the most astonishing looking games I've ever played and a fine testament to Naughty Dog's ability to wring the best out of the PS3. The voice acting again is superb as are the performances from Nolan North and the rest of the crew. My only gripe is that the finale lacks punch and the plot as a whole plays it rather safe with one moment towards the end where a main character gets killed only to turn up safe and well moments later. The multiplayer experience is a considerable improvement over UC2 and I've already sank dozens of hours into it. There are a wealth of new perks, upgrades and other goodies that compel you to keep playing. I can't wait for the forthcoming DLC map packs. The games as standard has 12 maps, some new and some old and they're all great and very varied. This is easily one of the greatest multiplayer experiences I've ever had. All in all this is an astonishing game and a worthy sequel and gets my firm vote for best game of 2011.",The_Seeker

Single player is exactly how the game should be.. fast corridoor action game with tonnes of diving and bullet-time physics, along with excellent cutscenes that move fluidly between action and story in a way that is seemless. Where the game starts to look a bit shabby is the bolt-on multiplayer game side of things. While singleplayer is suited to the 3rd person view, competive play most certainly is not, for starters the crosshair is off centred so you often can't see the target when behind cover without exposing your arse making the cover system a bit flakey when combined with the iffy locking method it uses. The other big issues are ""always on radar"" which is very noob for a game with such tiny maps, sure you can earn xp unlocks to help reduce visibility but really this game should not have a radar at all as default, sadly you have to grind out 5000 kills to play hardcore mode that doesn't feature this.  My final annoyances are the fairly low map count and that most of them are pretty damn small COD size crap, I was expecting at least something more in line with a single zone from GTA4 size, also they are touting a season DLC pass for £20, which is loathsome and ends up making the game cost £70 to have a complete game which is a ripoff no matter what they add.

Weak dreary soundtrack that quickly gets turned off.BUT.... here's the thing... even with that taking all that into consideration, it's still one hell of a good online racing game, and here's why.WHAT'S RIGHT:-1. Shedloads of cars to buy and upgrade (notice many whingers say that it doesn't have it must have pirate copies since they all failed to mention that you CAN modify and customise cars in the multiplayer half of the game).2. Handling of the cars IS arcadey... but so was GRID1, anyone that says GRID1 was a sim racing is talking utter  it never was close to being one and still isn't now. Even the older TOCA games were not really sim racing level, have a look at games due later in the year like project CARS or i-racing etc if you want sim racing you utter morons.3. Having no  view is annoying maybe but who really gave a crap using it anyway? looked good on replays but even on sim racing games I play, I find having virtual wheels in front of my real wheel looks stupid, not to mention the field of view is always set for some short arse hobbit, I'm quite tall and in a real car I don't see the bloody wheel in front of my nose EVER!4. There are plenty of racing modes to offset the lack of tracks, many are new to the series.5. Want stock cars? go play Dirt Showdown.Overall I'm giving this a solid 80% because the game is great online, pirates moaning about lacking single player probably missing the point entirely... thats a training mode for multiplayer.",HighwayUK

I played Diablo 1 when it first came out and for the next several years if anyone asked me what my favourite game was - I would have answered without hesitation - ""Diablo"". And then the sequels came out, neither one of which could compare to the original. Path of Exile takes what was great about the original Diablo and actually uses it, unlike its sequels, while at the same time adding cool new features.It's a pretty short game, experienced players can go from start to finish on the first difficulty level in 2-4 hours. That is a bonus in these types of games because it contributes to replayability - you can easily try out different character builds while not wasting 10 hours going through the game. Some other games try to solve this by letting you completely re-spec your character, and well - those games I will not be replaying, since there is no motivation to do so. And remember - in this type of game the gameplay IS mostly character customization, since there isn't exactly an amazing story or skill and precision-required combat like in action-adventure or fps games. It's all about the combination of abilities you pick and your inventory.The best aspect of this game is, of course, the skills and abilities. This is where Diablo 3 failed, and Path Of Exile very much succeeded. Giant passive abilities tree, every class has access to every other class' skills. Some people complain that the freedom is illusionary and you're still stuck within your class boundaries if you want to make a playable character - and that's not true. If you're playing casually and are not trying to make a hardcore character to last all 3 difficulty levels -  you can make viable builds of all kinds and still have fun. Combining skills with other skills is an amazing feature too, and is something I really wish I saw more of in other games. I'm still finding new fun combinations using skills I've overlooked in the past, (spell totem + spark + multiple projectiles + fork = you got your own mini boss from one of the areas!).At a first glance this game appears to have the same ""trash"" problem as Diablo - useless (non magic) items all over the ground that you'll never bother picking up. Except this issue has actually been addressed in Path of Exile. There are skills that let you use up non-magical weapon and armor items lying on the ground to create a companion, who actually inherits the properties of those items (for example, if one of those items had energy shield - the companion will have it too). And these items can also be converted to magical if one so desires, for example in case of an optimal socket configuration (which sometimes is impossible to find).Music and art assets are good too. I read in someone's review that ""music was crap"" and honestly have no idea what they are talking about. (they probably don't either).Unlike any other game of this genre, Path of Exile also has end-game content: once you reach a certain level you start finding ""maps"" that give you access to stand-alone high-level areas.The one thing I would not praise is the story, but then again this is not the right genre to expect a great story from, (that's what Bioware RPG's are for).Although of course, if you're one of those people who will hate on this game just because it's a Diablo clone and/or doesn't have a Blizzard stamp on it - then don't bother playing it, because no matter how good the quality of the game is you'll blindly hate it anyway.",SquishyEye

If you're looking for a single player game of the same quality as a free-to-play MMORPG, then you may enjoy this, other than that - don't waste your time and money.Combat and movement mechanics are horrid: if you're standing on a hill - your attacks go perpendicular to your character, so if an enemy is right in front of you and you're theoretically targeting them - your projectiles go right above their heads (or into the hill at their feet, if you're below them). There doesn't appear to be a way to cancel your long-charge combo attacks, so if you see a new enemy jump out from the side of the screen while in the middle of a combo - you're screwed, forced to just sit there and helplessly watch yourself getting hit. The game is completely 2D as far as the movement plane goes, there is no jumping aside from a few designated spots (with a special animation). Smallest rocks on the ground have huge collision boxes, making you walk all the way around them instead of over them, (and i'm not exaggerating - some of those rocks are maybe 3 inches tall, it is incredibly dumb that your character constantly gets stuck on them trying to walk past.).Leveling-up mechanics (skill and ability trees) and inventory management are pretty much straight from Dragon Age (and i'm sure a bunch of other much older games, but Dragon Age is the first one that comes to mind), so nothing original or unique there. I'm not exactly criticizing re-using old techniques, but just emphasizing the fact that there isn't anything ground-breaking which would make up for all the bad things.Graphics are at a World of Warcraft level. Considering how old WoW is, i'm sure that says a lot.And to top it all there are game-breaking bugs that there is no way to get around, aside from reloading a much earlier save game at the beginning of a quest line and trying again (hoping the bug won't happen again). I would have even forgiven not being able to complete that particular quest and just moving on to others, but this game didn't even let me do that - i was just stuck in one place with no ability to go anywhere.Overall - really badly made game. A 6 out of 10 *at most*. And if it wasn't for the slightly-above-mediocre art/music/writing, i wouldn't have given it more than 4 out of 10.And i can't believe the critic score is 8, this is the first game I've played with a metascore score so far away from the score it actually deserves.",SquishyEye

However, I would recommend Arkham City, its successor, over this because it surpasses it on nearly every level.I am hardly the world's greatest Batman fan, so I was cautious at first, but I found the game absolutely stunning. It has a very solid overall feel to it in that it is very polished and the gameplay is tight. It simply never lets itself up at any point. The story is engaging (though I personally preferred Arkham City's), the stealth mechanics are excellent, the missions are designed very well, and the voice acting is top notch (Star Wars fans should take note that Mark Hamill seems to be speaking half the time you're playing). More importantly, though, it makes you feel like Batman. You can take on loads of enemies in a brawl, use a small variety of gadgets to help you through the levels, yet you are not invincible - this means you have to use Batman's traditional stealth in order to take on armed enemies.The combat system, though good, can be frustrating at times, because the counter mechanic feels very broken. Thankfully, it is fixed in Arkham City and your problems of failing to counter when clicking the button are all gone. Another problem I found in this game - though many may not care - is that it is very linear. Another combat problem is that taking on enemies from a high point, or from underground, is broken as a result of this being a PC port - I have the game on PS3 as well, and it works fine on that. Again, this is all fixed in Arkham City, so the cool takedowns where you pop up from underground and grab an enemy, or when you hang an enemy from a ledge, are back in the sequel. There are no side missions at all and there is no open world feel, despite you having the ability to wander around the island as you wish. I guess I'm just a fan of non-linear games, so Arkham City's sidequests and exploration are of much appeal to me.Ultimately, this is a fantastic game but has a few important flaws. All is solved in the sequel, so if you must choose between the two I'd go for the second one. Regardless, this game is top quality.",Treeroy

This is an open world game with hundreds of side missions, but they are boring as hell. The TRON one looks cool, then gets annoying after the first 20 seconds. The helicopter missions are too predictable, and the tiger escort ones are just plain nonsense. Having a tiger in your car is a fun concept no doubt, but it is hopelessly ruined when you have no idea what you're meant to be doing and the mechanics do not work.There is a serious lack of multiplayer where there is great potential, and Whored Mode is tiresome (though in fairness, that is the point of it).In one line, the game is absurdly fun and should be experienced by everyone because of its extremity, but it simply does not last.",Treeroy

In the story missions there are a few big explosions, which look visually impressive. The graphics are very good, too, and it's playable on many systems. But although hopping between cars, planes and boats is entertaining, it's only enjoyable for a few hours before it gets old. It's worth noting that there are lots of people claiming that this game has a fully - or mostly - destructible world. It doesn't - there are a couple of things that look different when you blow them up, and that's it -- just to clear that claim up.Now, then, on to the bad things. Firstly, the voice acting is awful. It is without doubt the worse voice acting in any game I have played, bar none. The game is set on some sort of island in south Asia, so all of the voices - from the main protagonist to the least important character - are Americans putting on atrocious Asian accents. You might not think that bad voice acting can let the game down, but it cannot be avoided here. The missions are repetitive and necessary for progress; I actually ended up giving up on the game eventually because the missions' repetitiveness wasn't justified by the bland storyline. The story is just bad. You have no idea what's going on and just seem to be doing things for no real reason - and that's because the game tells you what's happening at the start, and by the end of the first mission you have forgotten. The other main problem with it is the open world - it is a sandbox game, but no one of any importance exists in it except yourself, which reiterates my point about the game getting boring quickly.Overall, a fun game for a few hours - good, looking, too - but massively let down by its exceptionally bad voice acting, uncompelling story, dull world and horrendous repetitiveness.",Treeroy

The graphics are phenomenal, from claustrophobic caves to lush forests to vast oceans and mountain ranges, you never feel bored of your stunning surroundings. I was apprehensive of the new Leviathan axe, Kratos' new primary melee weapon, however the progression system for moves and abilities as well as the enhancements you can make to the Leviathan axe, not to mention Atreus' bow, keep you very much engaged and working towards the next upgrade. You can also throw down and go bare knuckles if you please, which like the axe, rage and Atreus' bow has it's own skill tree. Kratos and Atreus also have several armor options to aid them on their journey and enhance certain play styles. Kratos' son Atreus proves to be a vital asset in the game and is essential for progressing through the story as well as aiding in fights. The fighting is varied and fluid, with a wide variety of moves and many types of enemies to practice on including some epic boss battles, but there are also the slow points when Kratos takes the time to tell his son a story whilst they paddle across the Lake of the Nine or the two take in their surroundings giving the player time to do the same. There are unique places to discover and many puzzles throughout the realms, some requiring you to return later in the game when your and your weapons abilities have grown. There is so much detail to each area, and the developers encourage exploration from the start, allowing the player to truly appreciate each place as they progress through the game. With many side-quests, you can follow the main story or branch out and explore the greater world, allowing for ultimate freedom during your play through.

275355,Far Cry 5,PlayStation4,7,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        First off, I am not interested in politics beliefs being forced on me while playing a game, so I am relieved this game did not dive deep into the current American political landscape. Most negative reviews focus on that, I think it is silly to expect such a thing from any game, but especially something like Far Cry. That said the story is a bit empty, I think it would be more engaging if the central character, ""the deputy"", spoke. Silent protagonists are weird and I can never relate to them.Story aside Hope County, Montana is an interesting place from afar. With all the delay and hype I was a bit surprised at how similar Far Cry 5's new engine resembles the build from Far Cry 4 and primal. The environment is pretty and colorful but lacks depth, you do not feel like you can really engage with anything. Think GTA V, almost 5 years old now, where you feel compelled to study the little details in a room or on a landscape and actually feel like they can be interacted with. Not to mention most things you shoot do not react. There is a somewhat plastic like feel to Far Cry 5 that is hard to ignore, like you could easily punch through the surface. This is the same issue as it's predecessors and something I expected would change.  How a game like Far Cry 5 in 2018 has not better incorporated destructible environments and detail rich landscapes is beyond me. And be prepared, because just like the last two games there are only about 2 or 3 villain models, so you often find you are shooting and blowing up the same guys over and over. Revamping these types of details, richer more immersive environments and a speaking protagonist would go a long way to make Far Cry 5 a better and more memorable game. Wasn't that the whole point of waiting 2-3 years?The weapons: I feel like the last two games respectively had an increasing arsenal that never left you wanting more. It was a nice surprise after completing a long campaign mission in Far Cry 4 to be rewarded with new weapons to buy that had previously not been visible in the store. It left something to work for, and a surprise to be excited about as you progressed. Here, perhaps because of the inclusion of more vehicles, the weapons selection is hugely trimmed down. I kept waiting for more to appear but now at the end of the game I realize that is not going to happen. I was very disappointed not to see more contemporary weapons and just a small variety of classics. For example the sub machine gun category basically has two guns, an old WW2 era machine gun with low damage that oddly becomes available later in the game, and three varieties of the MP5 all with basically the same stats. With sniper rifles and assault rifles it is the same situation: 2-3 choices. This is the 5th iteration and the games central appeal is gun play yet Ubisoft removes 75% of the guns from the game leaving a bare bones selection that you tire of quickly. This results in the guns that require further progression to unlock and buy are the same guns you already have, just with a different paint job or shorter stock, pretty lame. The mod system is exactly the same as the last two games as well, I was hoping for a grenade launcher attachment or laser sights, something to set this game apart.These complaints aside Far Cry 5 has its moments. A truck would come out of nowhere and crash me off the road, forcing me to think fast and fight for my life. Or I would have to jump into a tractor and mow down zombie-like drugged cultists. Often times the game would take you somewhere when you least expected it, and mostly it was fun. Far Cry 5 shines in these little moments. Also some of the less significant characters are quite entertaining. The Peggy's philosophy could be better developed and more intriguing to add a level of complexity that is missing. It can also be frustrating to have just taken over an outpost and still be looting the place, to suddenly become drugged and whisked off to one of Faith's weird hallucinations in the Bliss. It is times like these where the action in Far Cry 5 is actually at odds with the story. I don't care about your stupid nonsensical beliefs, I was in the middle of hunting a bear! In the new progression system you increase your resistance level by completing missions, helping the rebels and capturing outposts, but reaching a certain level causes you to suddenly be forced to take part in a boss battle after barely surviving the capturing of an outpost when you have few supplies remaining. Bad timing, let me prepare for the fight with the tools you have made available instead of forcing me into one. Overall I was disappointed after all the waiting and hype, but it is still a Far Cry game at its core and most fans will have a good time returning to this universe, though it may leave a few things to be desired. Lets hope the upcoming DLC will help and hopefully add more weapons, I did buy the season pass after all!  7.5/10",cabezatuck

If you enjoy PvE content then bloodborne is great, but the PvP is lacking. PvP is very important to me, I don't see myself playing it much more in its current state.Graphics- The graphics are great. Its actually spooky at times, unlike dark souls 2. The only problem is that there is such  little variety. Victorian era city, a forest, not really much else. The same goes for basic enemies, there just aren't that many different ones. It gets stale quickly. The design for bosses aren't that much better, although its a definite step up from dark souls 2 bosses.Solo PvE- Bloodborne definitely shines with this from a story perspective, but the gameplay falls a bit short. You have limited healing, but unlike previous souls games, they don't replenish after a bonfire/lamp visit. This means you are almost guaranteed to grind a bit on your first playthrough.  Later on, you will get plenty of souls to buy them, so its not too bad. The same goes for the new bullets. The concept is great and very enjoyable, but you are likely to find yourself grinding for more bullets on your first playthrough. Blood echoes (the new souls) are in fairly limited supply early on. Early bosses only give a few thousand echoes.Coop PvE- Kinda a huge **** honestly. I don't know why nobody is pointing it out. In previous games, the boss would get a small buff to account for the extra player. Still, coop was helpful because it allowed you to swap aggro a bit, and sometimes speed up the fight. In bloodborne, your summon(s) get reduced health, but the bosses are left unchanged. Its very noticeable and I looked it up to be sure. What you get from this is every boss becomes a spanking. Just you and your pals run up and wail on the boss, which will stunlock most of them and take them down in 20-30 seconds. Not enjoyable.PvP-  Another huge **** The invader has reduced health (30% less if I recall correctly). Aside from that, theres a lot of unbalanced stuff. Guns aren't really fun because they are no-risk parries that can also do a bit of damage. Theres not that much build variety, atleast not now and it could be because there are significantly less weapons. The new spells are terrible, they consume your limited bullets and are also just weak in general. As such, arcane is fairly weak. Most builds can just do vitality, endurance, and strength/skill.",TimTeamTebow

Personally, I think the animations more than make up for the few moments of pixel squishiness. Ultimately, the game still holds up well for a 14 year old title.SF3 isn't SF4... it's a challenging game which rewards you for your patience and effort. Great stuff.",BubblegumImp

'Lite' allows players to configure and map certain special moves (Supers, Ultras etc.) to the 3DS' touchscreen. The result is a fighting game for both the hardcore and relative noobs.

What comes as a pleasant surprise is how well Crysis has made the transition from PC to consoles.The gameplay centers around the nanosuit, a living suit of armor which imparts superhuman abilities to the player. These abilities are tagged to 3 categories: Armor, Power and Stealth. Using each ability drains an energy meter. Players are then left to their own devices as to how they would like to use these abilities. It injects a welcome dose of strategy into the well worn FPS genre. Will you storm in with armor and tank it up? Or will you descend from above, dispensing silent death with stealth? Crysis 2 gives you the sandbox and the tools to play it YOUR way.Unfortunately, while the core gameplay is fantastic, the plot and AI has some noticeable flaws. The story can feel tacked on and incoherent amidst the insanity of constant gunfire and explosions. As for the AI, it can go from smart to jarringly stupid in the blink of an eye. Don't be surprised to see CELL soldiers walking into a wall 2 feet from where you just barged in through a door.The music and sound is amazing and does a fine job complementing the beautiful visuals. With a score which bears more than a passing resemblance to Harry Gregson Williams' work, you'll feel like a military badass in no time. The sound editing is the best in the shooter genre since Halo Reach and Medal of Honor. Amazing effects which pack a punch and place you directly into the action.As with most shooters, Crysis 2 packs a multiplayer component which has been heavily influenced by COD4. That means, you'll rank up and unlock 'perks'. The problem with most FPS is balance and Crysis 2 in its current form has some big balance issues. Jump into any quick match and be prepared to be pummeled by snipers and stealth users. Hopefully, this will be fixed in a future patch.In short, Crysis 2 is fantastic.

The Menu interface is also a bit tedious at times, as you will open a chest with a weapon in it, only to be told you don't have enough room so the chest closes, you have to open the menu, drop one of the weapons you have, reopen the chest, including the open animation, and then get the item. Those are my two legitimate complaints, this game is very enjoyable, and if you have a Wii U, this is a must own, even if you wait to get it.

However, it's a catch 22 because if you're playing a lot, particularly warzone, you will want more req packs.The req pack system isn't awful, but it's clearly designed in a way to get you to spend a **** load of money to get the stuff you want, and as somebody who has been playing halo since the first one, it is an unwelcome change.Final Thoughts: If you own an xbox one, grab it it is a solid game. If you bought an xbox one for it like I did, reconsider unless you know you have multiple friends who plan to do the same. Teammates will make or break your experience.",owenw218

I did a lot of this and felt like it wasn't really that useful without really trying to immerse myself into it.The story and dialogue options are watered down from the previous games. This might be ok for casual, newcomers but for fans of the series, you will inevitably be disappointed both in the dialogue options and the story arcs.Ultimately, this game is fun and I got my money's worth out of it, but it isn't the game I hoped it would be in several key areas, particularly in dialogue options. The different character builds offer a lot of interesting ways to play, making subsequent playthroughs worthwhile, but it falls short of the hype and expectations.I'd say this is worth getting if you're even somewhat interested in the series,  I put in 40 hours before feeling worn out on it.

271202,Final Fantasy XV,PlayStation4,8,"After completing the game and putting about 40 hours into it, I would say this game is a solid 8 out of 10.Pros:+ Amazing soundtrack, with tons of previous FF music available as you progress, with the mp3 key item you can listen to music from previous Final Fantasy games while you run around the over world. Thematically, it is incredible.+ Gorgeous visuals, I played on lite modeAfter completing the game and putting about 40 hours into it, I would say this game is a solid 8 out of 10.Pros:+ Amazing soundtrack, with tons of previous FF music available as you progress, with the mp3 key item you can listen to music from previous Final Fantasy games while you run around the over world. Thematically, it is incredible.+ Gorgeous visuals, I played on lite mode on a PS4 Pro and it looks really good with mostly decent fps. It stutters a bit but it's not going to hurt the experience that much. I usually game at 60fps on my pc and didn't have much of an issue.+ Fun albeit somewhat boring at times combat. It's action packed and not like FF13 which I like, but it does sort of boil down to holding down O or Square while pushing a direction on the Left stick. I never got too bored of it, but by 40 hours in, I was hoping for a bit more variety.+ Fun overworld with plenty to do. The sidequests are good, not great much of the time, and compared to the Witcher 3, leave a bit to be desired. However the rewards and variety are enough to keep it fun for quite some time.+ The relationship between the four protagonists. At first, I felt a bit luke warm toward the characters, but as the story went on, it was awesome seeing them all interact. It feels like you're along on the journey with them, and while the story telling isn't always perfect, the relationship between the four is mostly enjoyable and fun.Cons+ The story isn't terrible, in fact I enjoyed it quite a bit more of the time than not, but there are some missing pieces that make following it difficult. I love Final Fantasy games, so esoteric, difficult to understand stories are something I don't mind, but without watching outside content or reading up on the lore outside of the game is required for a fuller understanding, and that's a shame because while I may be willing to do a bit of that, most people would prefer that to be all ""in house"" and I can't blame them.+ Glitches. They're not super frequent but they appear every now and then, and sometimes require you to save and reload to fix them. For a game of this size and scope, they're forgivable but they do exist.Final Thoughts: I think this is a solid game if you have, or haven't played a final fantasy game. At the time of writing this, the developers claim to be releasing some free dlc as well as paid, and the free dlc is supposed to address some of the story telling issues, though it may be too little too late for those of us who have already purchased it and played through it. If you like rpgs, and the FF series, I would say this game is absolutely worth the full price of $60 if you can't find a sale, especially if the free dlc does even just a little bit more in terms of making the game better.",owenw218

A Batman game that will go in the history books as one of the best Batman's of all time! There were a few things here and there that were poor but the other aspects of the game make up for it. The Dark Knight is one of my most favorite super heroes in the DC universe and I enjoyed this game A LOT!Story is that Joker has taken over Arkham Asylum and is trying to kill the Batman and bring destruction to Gotham City. He and some other super criminals are teaming up to stop you! Pretty simple story but well told with how the characters are portrayed and designed which brings me to my next paragraph.The characters.... wow. They were right on the money with them. Perfect. Batman's silent, dark, firm, and serious attitude. The Jokers insane behavior and what he believes as funny. Harley Quinn's absolute loyalty to the Joker and her insanity with it. Everyone was portrayed and designed amazingly well except for how they fight. Their fighting was... well dull. I can understand Scarecrow though there's not much you can do for him except what they put in here. Another point to the Scarecrow though for actually scaring the living s*** out of me.Graphics and visuals were all top notch. The character designs were amazingly well done. Batman's suit was fantastic and as well as the carry on scratches and cuts he takes from his battles on Arkham. The prison was dark and gritty and suits the mood to the Batman series.Gameplay  is fluid and easy but also frustrating. Not frustrating in a bad way mind you frustrating at yourself for messing up the amazing combo you were doing You got to have amazing timing amazing reflexes to press the right key/button at the right time and make sure you don't reset your combo meter. You think ""Oh it's gonna be easy then."" well it isn't. When you have a bunch of various bad guys that require a certain thing to be able to dodge them disarm them stun them so and and so forth it becomes a lil confusing and a test for you as you have 18 guys surrounding you trying to beat you. It's like Assassin's Creed's combat only done right. It was a good stress pushing me to become better and trying to learn the games controls. The stealth aspect was marvelous. Although I don't quite understand why there are so many gargoyles in the game (possibly a flaw but can be overlooked) the further you go the more of a challenge it becomes. The inmates will start getting Heart meters to know where you take em down. Goggles to see the dark corners where the gargoyles are places. They'll start destroying the gargoyles. I didn't find it all too challenging as I got further unlike the multiple baddy fighting. Guess I have a knack for stealth. If they added a timer though and the Joker released a gas into the room... that would make it a challenge.The difficulty of the game is excellent. It gives you a challenge as the further you go the more the AI adapts to your cunning and stealth. The controls are perfect it's so fluid and easy to do. It just requires excellent timing and quick reflexes much like how Batman would require only a lot more simpler and less life threatening. This is where the one flaw comes in to play on the game. Boss battles. WHAT THE F***?! I have never seen such poorly designed boss battles in all my life. Dodge the baddy and let him run into a wall? This is how all boss battles are?! Unless you count Scarecrow as a boss battle but a platform puzzle to dodge the spot light is hardly what I'd call a boss battle.Would I recommend this game? YES! GO BUY IT NOW!",Afroman22

It's got great options for your units you are controlling and has great ways to really make each battle a little more exciting.What's Here: X-Com as I said before is an RTS turn based. Planning and careful consideration of each move must be taken into place here or you could wind up dead. Aliens are coming to take over our planet and it's up to us to stop them learning from their technology to better equip ourselves to be better at the fight. Story is generic and boring so it's really just the gameplay that's keeping you here.Gameplay: It's turn based and it's hard to explain all the options there without it being long winded. Pretty much you can either decide to move twice move then shoot shoot right at the start take cover and so on. It makes you try to think things out and move cautiously because if you charge forward right away you can run into enemies and they can gun you down easily. You need to take cover consider your gear and consider your surroundings. You also need to consider what class to bring along with you to make sure you have a functional squad. It's really different and hard to take in for new people to RTS at first but everyone should be more than capable to learn what's going on. In the story you have to fight airships sometimes... but it's not really fighting it's just... watching wires duke it out. Which is dull and boring.Visuals: While they are not exactly eye popping they do have their plus sides to details on weapons on the characters in game. You can see the glow each marking and all kinds of stuff. The armors are well designed that's for sure. The alien designs too were truly outstanding. Each one was unique and full of color and life and some even scared the crap outta me when they popped up on my screen behind me. This was really well done. As for the maps it was ok. I mean they weren't eye popping but what really got me was how destructive everything was around it. The more you and the aliens fight the more torn up the map becomes. That really got me there.Sound: Music replays over and over again. I turned it off and started playing my own music. Gun noises well there is only 3 variety of guns regular, laser and, plasma and there is a sniper, assault rifle, shotguns, machine guns, and rocket launchers. They were good but it didn't really stand out for me So... not much there either. Voice acting was just a snooze fest.Controls: Well it's not hard it just takes time to learn but you get use to it fast. It even controlled with a gamepad but it is for PS3 and Xbox so I assumed nothing less if it's on those.Recommendation: This game is a 7/10 in my book due to the lacking music and sounds and the more detailed visuals as well as lacking story. Overall though the gameplay and dynamic field really help save it where it lacks in that makes this game a higher score then what I would have given it without seeing those things. While this game has it's flaws it's worth taking a look at if you are an RTS fan or just want to get into RTS.",Afroman22

You can customize the guns to your style of play and you can take two different approaches most of the time to your style of play. Stealth or Run n' Gun. You may also explore the island and take on different missions and side quests as well. Although as the story progresses it takes a sharp decline as one of the protagonists just vanishes and makes you question a lot of things. I don't like to talk about the story much so if you play you can find out.Gameplay: The game plays out like your usual FPS where you run shoot climb shoot duck shoot and overall just slaughter your way through thousands of enemies. So yeah it's generic but how it unfolds is where it's at! You can make the game a whole lot easier by doing the side quests and outposts and becoming a much more stronger Warrior and taking on Vaas and Hoyt's armies. The hunting is truly done well as each section has their own environments and you can even watch animals hunt other animals. Which brings me to my next part.Visuals: If you have the PC for it you'll defiantly see it! WOW! JUST WOW! The island is just beautiful. The lush trees. The animal designs. The water. The beach. The gun designs. Nothing beats seeing it all while on your hand glider too! it's a real breath taking experience seeing it all on Ultra. Ubisoft really outdid themselves here!Sounds: While music isn't all that great but it's not bad just doesn't stand out the voice acting deserves massive amount of credit here. Michael Mando playing the part of Vaas really out did himself here. You'll want to play the game again just to hear the parts! It's so amazing! The guns have stellar sounds as well. No complaints here on them as they sounded pretty damn good. When explosives go off near you and how sounds knida mute out and you get dizzy that was well done as well it pulled me in and made me think I was in the fight.Controls: While keyboard and mouse are difficult for driving at times for me they may not be for all I found it a lot easier on gamepad to drive than anything else but I learned... well a lil after so many hours of game play. I still suck though. So driving is difficult but everything else works great! No problems handling the hand glider or driving (with my gamepad) or shooting at all. Extremely responsive and no bugs or glitches to report on my end.Overall: This game is a 9/10! It loses points because the story towards the end was just down right boring and generic. Though there were some parts that made me cringe and go wow... what the  I would defiantly recommend this game to everyone.Warning: This does require UPlay which is a huge disappointment! I was extremely pissed off at first but the game is still a 9/10... I just hate Ubisoft for doing this ",Afroman22

Every time I went somewhere new it always started with a ""Wow."" or ""Amazing..."" This game is defiantly worth it's money. Another note is... this game instantly gets 2 bonus points for a PERFECT PORT to PC. This puts a lot of AAA game industries to shame.Story is fantastic. It's well told. It's not going to be something phenomenal but just how the pacing is done and how each part is teaching Dust a lesson as he gets his memories back and how it tells us a little bit of his past at the same time just keeps you going and wanting more. Although I don't know what to say about the ending but maybe a sequel for this amazing game?Characters here are memorable and I will never forget them. Some people will have problems with the characters being Furry but no one had a problem with StarFox now did they? So get over it. Dust and Fidget are an amazing duo and I couldn't help but laugh almost every time Fidget spoke. Her disregard for the fourth wall and the jokes with it just cracked me up. Dust's core character is really generic but his voice actor brings him to life and makes you feel the emotions he's going through It never once came to my mind that ""Ew, Dust, is really generic."" and I hope no one else feels the same. The sword Ahrah doesn't have a huge impact but you can defiantly see him as support role as well as main. He's trying to bring back Dust into someone better and reteach him his skills. That's enough to make me remember him.So this game is a 2D side stroller so it's visuals and graphics must be sub-par right? Wrong! It never once made me think they were poor or under developed. I thought they were amazing and really high end for a game like this. The enemies were detailed the backgrounds were amazing the character cut scenes were superb! Did I really pay 15 dollars for this game?Gameplay and controls are stellar! I mean it just feels, perfect. Everything responds quickly it moves smoothly it's just, fantastic. I can't really go into detail because, I can not really describe it. It's just amazing.Difficulty falls short or maybe I'm just skilled? I stuck it on Tough my first run through and found it anything but tough. Most of my deaths come from hazardous terrain. Never did I see any boss or monster challenging. Again though I think I am a great gamer as when my friend and my girlfriend played this on Tough they had difficulty with a lot of enemies. So I can't really say for sure if the game is too easy or too hard. I guess it just depends on how good of a player you are.Would I recommend this game? Hell yeah! GO BUY IT NOW DAMMIT! This is an absolute required game for everyone! I still can't believe I payed so little for this game. I would have easily paid 40 dollars for this!",Afroman22

Then when I think of the depth of this game and how each NPC has different tastes and preferences how they all act differently and each is unique in their own way it reallyRecettear has a great amount of gameplay for what I paid. 20 dollars for this game is not exactly a good price but translating Japanese can be difficult but there are people who translate things like this for free. Then when I think of the depth of this game and how each NPC has different tastes and preferences how they all act differently and each is unique in their own way it really brings the game to life making it worth that 20 dollars. Anyways moving on this game was pretty well done and very surprising. I enjoyed it a lot.Story is fairly unbelievable. A little girls father who has disappeared leaves his daughter with a huge crippling debt. She's only 10 (I am guessing?) how is she spose to repay his debt? Why the fairy Tear tells her to make a store so she can pay it back. The lil loli Recette gets help and turns her house into a store. While the story was fairly unbelievable and lacking there isn't much to do but if you do the RPG dungeon part more stories unfold and builds up more character for Recette and Tear and the Adventurers.Characters in the game have a huge impact. Everyone is unique and different and the events that happen make them rememberable enough. The more you unlock the more events that will happen interacting with all the characters all together. It gives incentive to do the dungeon part of the game to unlock more of these characters with their corky bits and pieces.Visuals and Graphics. It's 8-Bit and it's Indie. What more can I expect for a game with this much depth? Not great but monster bit-maps were great. The art for the NPC  Background pictures were great notch. Overall I'd have to say it's well done but I still knida wished for a 720p version or something.The challenge the game presents is up to how smart your are and if you can pull it off. Me? I feel I'm pretty smart although I don't want to boast about it but I can say that some of my other friends can't even get past the 2nd week. So it's defiantly up to your own skills to be able to make this game and easy or an impossible experience.There are two different types of gameplay here. Running the Store and the Dungeon Crawling. Running your store was great but a challenge. Everyone has a different budget and you have to learn that by personality and age. The little girl is well in fact a little girl so she doesn't have much money. Louie is poor but the more adventuring you do with him the more money he gets and if you sell to him cheap he starts to get a bigger and better budget. It's so crazy and complex that each character in the game has specific things and goals and all this other crap that it's difficult to explain! Combat was simplistic but each Adventurer has their pros and cons and a different playstyle required. Not much to talk about here but it knida reminded me of Final Fantasy without the turn base thing.Would I recommend this game? Defiantly. It's a must buy. If 20 dollars is too much for your wallet though you'll have to wait for a Steam Sale or something. I don't see it move from that price much at all.,Afroman22

254261,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,PC,5,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I finished The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. It’s a noble failure. Best graphics I have ever seen. They perfected a new technique that translates photographs of environments into game art. They call it revolutionary and I can’t argue.The problem is not with the story. It’s well written and solidly delivered, with reasonable voice acting.The flaw is the game itself. At the start they state that the game doesn’t hold your hand, which is just a disclaimer for bad game design. They wanted to have an open-world, but they failed to explain what to do. You will almost certainly have to backtrack to the start of the game once you realise the right approach. Small spoiler: at the start of the game there are several man traps if you go off the path. Do not do the natural, intuitive thing and stay on the path. Find every man trap, even though the game doesn’t give you any explanation why you would want to. It’s typical of the opaque game design and it’s not the worst example. I had to resort to a walkthrough to finish, in other words the game failed me.It seems a game with a linear story requires a linear structure to frame it. I’d rather play Dear Esther, even though it’s not quite as pretty and the story is far less sophisticated.Having said that, if you can get the game cheaply, it is still worth buying simply to experience the environment.

It is about family, responsibility, love, loss, and most importantly - growing up. It brilliantly illustrates how the age difference among siblings can create qualities that complement each other, both at a physical and mental level. The older brother is stronger, knows how to swim, while the younger can pass through small gaps. The older brings maturity while the younger brings joy. It's fantastic really.The graphic is simplistic and cartoonish, which can be taken as a stylistic choice. Regardless, I find it beautiful. There are some great visuals that will surely amaze. The language is meaningless, like in The Sims. Yet they say enough with body language. It's often funny and entertaining.There are puzzles but they are really easy in my opinion. It's mostly about how you use the two of them together in different situations. The playthrough is very short. It took me about 2-3 hours.

COD to me is a cage match of pissed off players literally sprinting around pumping as much lead as possible at one another, but its fun..its entertaining I get it.  The thing I absolutely adore about battlefield is the fact you have to play it with a mindset of I can die at any second from any direction.  But you can't just run and gun for the most part in battlefield, you have to use your senses, your brain, out smart your opponent.  Its not a competition to see who can spray the most lead in hopes of getting the kill, your success falls on your accuracy, your choices of what to do & where to go under heat, and playing resourcefully.  Its not just a point your reticule on your opponent and shoot, the bullet trajectory and range is very impressive in this game.  Although the maps are smaller and the number of players smaller as well in the console version, which i can understand considering the hardware most computers have today compared to the 360.  The game gives you lots of options for server functions and filters to find exactly the type of game you are seeking.

Nowhere have I seen better writing in terms of believable dialogue and character interaction before. To those who have played Uncharted, and are thus doubtful about the constant 10s, rest assured it is a vastly different feeling. Where uncharted had serious dissonance between the violent and cold blooded Drake and the wacky and charming Drake, The Last of Us informs all of the play through characterization. All of the violence is brutal and harsh, and the game responds to that. It is a tale that only a game could tell, building an admittedly obvious plot into a 17 hour emotional narrative. the game has its moments of intensity, and  then falls back into thorough scavenging, a slow walk through exquisitely detailed houses and towns. The flow is finely tuned to perfection, and leaves the player engrossed in the story. In total, The Last of Us is a work of art, one that anyone who enjoys a strong emotional experience should play.",scoutwags

What changes they do make add quite a bit to the flow and customization options, where the map pathing is put together to create an incentive to move continuously, making the games as fast as intended.

Combat is fast and intense, and using your suit's booster jets to power slide across battefields never gets dull. The weapons are satisfying for the most part, however others like the LFE gun and Lock-on Laser aren't very useful, and there aren't many weapons in the game altogether so you're likely to stick to the same 3 or 4 weapons for the entire game. The boss battles are a treat, with quick-time events given a wonderful over-the-top execution. There isn't much story and what little characters there are never really get developed. This would be forgiveable if the incredibly fun game play lasted much longer. On the easiest difficulty you'll finish this game within 4-5 hours. While you will very likely want to play through again on a harder difficulty immediately afterwards, it's still disappointing that the campaign is so short, and with no multiplayer and only online leaderboards, there isnt much else to do but to play through on the higher difficulties hunting trophies.

My only complaint is that the AI doesn't really present any challenge for anyone familiar with the total war franchise on lower difficulties, and on harder difficulties the AI does not play any better just simply gets buffs/player gets de-buffs.However the game is still incredibly fun with a strategic campaign and intense tactical battles. On it's own I would say this game is definitely worth it for the vortex campaign (which is more than you will ever need) but if you happen to already own Total War: WARHAMMER then you get the added benefit of the Mortal Empires Campaign which simply just combines the maps of the two games in an epic sandbox mashup, although not for the faint of heart with it's insanely long end turn phase and lack of narrative it is a great bonus for owning both titles and is easily something you could pour hundreds if not thousands of hours into.Overview9/10Definitely worth the priceIf you buy this and do not already own WARHAMMER 1 and are thinking of getting it just for Mortal Empires I would wait until it's on sale as I don't think it's worth paying full price just for that but even as little as %20 off and I would say go for it.",Fudgeyman
