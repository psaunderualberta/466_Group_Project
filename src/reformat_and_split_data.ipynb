The dungeons are interesting and unique, the characters are interesting and have personality, the story is highly engaging, the combat is varied, fluid, and fun, the items are amazing, there are a plethora of interesting side quests and collectibles, and considering the fact that this game was made in 1998 the graphics are amazing. The only real downside is that the game is somewhat linear and you can't continue on after beating the final boss, but that doesn't detract from the huge amount of fun I had playing this game. This has to be one of if not the best games ever made just as the others have said.",

All I hadI'm one of those people who think that this is the greatest game of all time, no matter what quality games are out now or will be out ever. This is just plain the best game I've ever played. Why? Partly because it was the first good game I've actually played. When I first got a Nintendo 64 I was considerably young, and yet every game I played I thought was absolutely horrible. All I had were simple objective games, and as a child I thought they were hard and pointless. Then one day Ocarina of Time was brought home and I at first refused to play it. So I watched my father play it for a while, and straight away it was something entirely new and different. Also at the time, it was the most real (to me at least). What brought me in was the ability to actually explore and get to know people, even if the people you talked to all repeated the same things over and over no matter how many times you talked to them, but it didn't matter. This game was something new and exciting to me, and to this day I get this good old nostalgic feeling whenever I play it. It has one of the greatest stories of all time for a video game and was one of the first to create its own sort of universe and it was one of the first 3D environment game where you can see in all 360 degrees (after Mario 64 that is). Plus to this day people are still discovering new secrets to the game and so many in-depth theories arise from this title alone based upon this game that keep it interesting. The characters feel like characters and the visuals are some of the most cinematic of its time. The gameplay is also very fun, which of course is one of the most important things and there are very involving puzzles that are simple enough in appears but very complex when you get down to it. There is so much that I could say about this game, but sometimes even looking back, I'm at a loss of words at how awesome this game is.",

Ocarina introduced the gaming world to the aspect of open world play with a wonderfully sized map that was large and full of exploration but not in the slightest bit unnecessary. The level and dungeon design was the best of it's time andThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is without a doubt one of the greatest video games of all time. To say that this game was great is an understatement. Ocarina introduced the gaming world to the aspect of open world play with a wonderfully sized map that was large and full of exploration but not in the slightest bit unnecessary. The level and dungeon design was the best of it's time and in still to this day remains one of most brilliant, beautiful, and interesting worlds of any video game on the market. Every area you explore from the moment you wake up in the lush and green forest of the Kokiri to the vast and deep desert of the Gerudos' is crafted to perfection. The combat system in Ocarina was also a shining star. Not only did weapons feel right, react well, and play out perfectly, but they were always interesting and had their own advantages. Not once did a weapon outshine another because they all had a great purpose. The Z-Targeting system was added for a more cinematic feel that worked flawlessly and it even made combat easier and more interesting. The music and sounds of the game brought it to life as well. Every area had it's own theme music that was unique to that zone and always felt right and gave the player that more personal feeling wherever he/she went. Kokiri Forest felt like a wonderful place of happiness while Hyrule Field had an epic and powerful tone to it. The addition of musical gameplay made things more interesting as well and showed an importance to every area the player visited. Now, most importantly to the Zelda series itself and to any video game for that matter, comes the story. The Legend of Zelda has always been a series shining in the glory of it's adventures and this was the biggest and most powerful of them all. You begin as a young boy who has always felt left out and who has nightmares of dark visions that would become realities. As you start your quest you realize your true destiny and embark on a journey filled with adventure and courage like no other. The dark king of the Gerudo's Gannondorf seeks the legendary Triforce and will stop at nothing to rule the land of Hyrule. By unleashing monsters from the Temples' of Hyrule and by turning the once good and just land to pure evil, Gannondorf attempts total rule over the world. Link being the Hero of Hyrule must journey to the different lands and temples' of the land in order to gain power from the mystical \"sages\" and stop Gannondorf. The story in Ocarina beings great and never lets go. In fact the game gets better every second that it progresses. You meet many interesting characters such as Princess Ruto, Malon, Darunia, and the mysterious Sheik that not only have their own individual traits, but also contain important roles in your quest. Also, each character is easily remembered and full of emotion which grasps the player and gives them a sense of caring and passion for each one. The many temples and dungeons visited during the game are all fun, unique, and interesting and reward the player as he/she progresses. The game has quite a few side quests that are entertaining and it follows through right up to the end. There is nothing negative about this game and to this day it stands on a pedestal as one of if not the greatest game of all time and for good reason. Since it's release very few games have captured the true story, art, and power Ocarina of Time had mastered back in 1998. To this day I myself still play it and still consider it my favorite game ever. Not because of great graphics, or online play, or anything else that current games have fallen into but because Zelda is a game that touched my heart like no other game ever has. Current game developers and enthusiasts need to look back at The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and reconsider the direction that games are going. Zelda mastered it, and for that we should honor it.",

                  "Comment": "            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game is do doubt the greatest game in existance. Non, except for Nintendo haters, have been able to play this game without admiting it is at least one of the best of the best, if not THE best of the best. Super Mario 64 was the first game to make 3D conversion work, but this was the game that perfected it. It introduced a large 3 dimensional world to explore, which at the time was a huge deal. It also introduced new gameplay mechanics that made the action adventure genre work out even more. Like the lock-on targeting system, which helped to keep your eye on the enemy much easier, but without making the fighting too easy, as you had to meneuver around the enemy and dodge his attacks. Another big new feature was horse-back riding. Riding your horse around the huge field was big and new. It had an engaging story, that really sucked you in, which had lots of twists and turns. Like when Ganondorf attacked the castle, destroying your plan to get the Triforce before Ganon did. Or near the end, when Shiek, the man who helped you on your journey as an adult, reveals himself to be Princess Zelda, the person Link had been searching long and hard for. Another thing was the conversion from Young Link to Adult Link. This was the first Zelda game that introduced Adult Link, making him look more epic, and more like the hero of the legends. But the bigger twist is how you can play as both Young Link and Adult Link. Not only that, but the story counts on you using both of them to make it all the way through the story. There are alot of complicated dungeons with puzzles to solve, which can sometime twist your brain, and make the game much more challenging. What I loved about Zelda was the flawless gameplay and beautiful landscapes. Zelda Ocarina of Time was a first, it brought forth the perfection of 3D conversion, and made it beautiful, but also made the 3D mechanics work with how the game played out, and it worked beautifully. Of course the game isn't perfect, there are a few flaws in Ocarina of Time. Like the Water Temple, which is the most unpopular dungeon in the game. Everyone had a hard time with it, so it proved to be a bit too challenging. Plus in some parts of the game, the graphics don't look good at all. However, these flaws are not severe enough to interfere with the games overall greatness. There may be no such thing as a perfect game, but this game is as close to a perfect game as you can get. Zelda Ocarina of Time won Game of the Year in 1998, and got an honorable award in outstanding gaming achievement in 1999, and it didn't win these awards without good reason. This game is truley the best game of all time, and anyone who thinks they can make a game better than this is absolutely crazy. Sure Ocarina of Time may not be outstanding by todays standards, but considering the technology of gaming at the time, it was the best gaming could offer. Even 13 years after the game came out, Ocarina of Time is still selling like nuts via the Wii Virtual Console, which re-released Ocarina of Time in 2007. In my opinion, Ocarina of Time is, and will always be, the greatest game ever made, and I'm not alone in that statement. I have yet to meet a person who is not a Zelda hater who played Ocarina of Time and thought the games was horrible. Ocarina of Time is the best of the best in gaming, hands down, and it deserves a perfect score more than any game.",

Pros: Beautiful graphics for the N64; subtle, but challenging gameplay; variety of dungeons, puzzles, and secrets; innovative and imaginative. Cons: If Ocarina of Time had faults, it would be its often dull dungeon design, camera issues, and it has one of the worst power-ups to date.",

I have never heard anyone saying anything remotely negative about this game, so I know that this is the correct ranking. This is THE golden standard of video games. This game is the reason I will never sell my Nintendo 64. Critic score is a 99? Anything less than a 100 is a sham. It's very true that there's no such thing as a perfect game, but everything in the world is completely arbitrary without an accepted standard. This game is the standard because it's the highest rated game of all time (Guinness World Records officially named it such). You have no choice but to compare this game to every other game. it is perfect in every way. It never gets boring and everything about it is just...perfect.",

Does it hold up today? In my personal opinion, it holds up pretty well and was pretty close to perfection. The visuals may look outdated today, but you cannot deny yourself that the atmosphere in the destinations within Hyrule are mesmerizing to explore in this game. The locations, the character designs, the temples, the story and the soundtrack (especially the soundtrack) are absolutely memorable through out this game and this game practically made me became a Zelda fan in the first place. I could see why there are some people whether they are Zelda fans or not that they are too fond with this Zelda title. It's a bit identical to A Link to the Past on the SNES, but with 3D rendered visuals and there is a lack of personality within many characters compared to the later Zelda games where character personalities has improved in. However, for Nintendo to produce an engaging story for their first 3D Zelda game, it became forgivable for its time. This maybe a really overrated Zelda game, but there's a reason why people prefer Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as an instant classic.",

Of course as this is an assassin's Creed game, you'll be in an open world map and this time it's back to constantinople. The free running technique has been modified and feels better than brotherhood but the melee is basacly the same. The new mode Den Defence is not all that good and after a while will become tedious and boring. In the game you can also craft bombs which will help you in your story. As always the graphics deliver and are brilliant to see. The one thing that is completly outstanding, is the multiplayer. With new modes and even more wepons to play with you will be on it for hours on end. Verdict: This Game is amazing in multiplayer and the story is brilliant.As always the Graphics are good especialy in the first scene with Ezio. The music fit's the game but Den Defence is not the best. If your an Assassin's Creed fan get the game but it may feel a bit like Brotherhood.

It is extremely annoying at times, especially because it has already seen it's existence since AC2 and had gotten worse.. Crashes doesn't happen just once or twice, probably a good 10+ in total.Graphics wise, there isn't much improvements from the previous titles, and looks just slightly better.My conclusion is that if you've enjoyed Ezio, Altair, and Desmond's stories, then Assassin's Creed Relevations is one title that you cannot miss, an EPIC end to the Altair/Ezio story. If not, then you probably won't enjoy it a whole lot.",

Ezio’s elegance, class, humour and all round entertaining persona carried the Assassin’s Creed franchise away from the monotone days of Altiar, into the success it has enjoyed in recent years. The same can be said for Revelations.The greatest asset of this game is Ezio, the performance by Rodger Smith is spot on and the writing has actually improved in relation to his lines making it more sophisticated to create a more believable story around a man looking for answers, that have deluded him over the previous games. In fact the story that actually centres on Ezio himself has never been so good, it’s a shame the plot around Constantinople is significantly weaker, portraying a power struggling in the Ottoman empire that you simple don’t come to care to much about. Over the game the story of Ezio will be neatly and most importantly satisfyingly tied up into a nice ribbon, doing the previous two games justice. However to get to this point you will have to get threw the other story plots including the Ottomans.The truth about this game is that you have most likely played it before, the fundamental mechanics, gameplay and style of game has not changed drastically since Assassin’s Creed II’s release in 2009. You will still be sent on quests by colourful characters to assassinate certain targets, find out important information to progress the story line and occasionally a nice curveball may be included such as stealing a street entertainers clothing and instrument. There is nothing wrong with this formula, as we know it works, however three games later it’s starting to wear thin.It must be said that Ubisoft has tried to innovate in some areas however even with some success, not enough has been done to actually make this game feel like a sequel rather then an extension pack. The hook blade does in fact create a new stance on combat and exploration, also the introducing of bomb crafting is a nice touch. Beyond this though is nothing but a tedious fort defence game and minor tweaks to the open world map. There is no way Ubisoft could get away with making so little changes again.Leaving these quarrels behind, if you have played the previous two titles in this series Revelations is definitely worth getting to complete the tale of one of video games most beloved characters, if you haven’t played any of the Assassin Creed games, I would strongly suggest buying Assassin’s Creed II as you get the same gameplay with a better story for a much lower price.In conclusion Revelations was a game needed to put Ezio to rest and it does this well, so it should be commended. Lets just hope that Ubisoft has a something up its sleeve so that it can build upon such a successful franchise.",

If you're an average person with 8 hours of free time, then consider more than 4% of it wasted due to these damn long credits, so I've decided to rate the game at 4.Ok, now the other things.. First problem I noticed after starting the game was Desmond's new weird baby-face look. I didn't even recognize him at first, it was way too weird..Moving forward through the game, the story was becoming a bit too much of a mind****, what with Ezio using magic stones to get into Altair's memories and Desmond's mental health problems.. It all seemed way too shady though as everything else from the city was trying to get your attention. What I really didn't get was all the strange new mechanics that the previous games didn't have. To be fair, it's nice to see some new mechanics, but when they come out of nowhere, often leading to your death, you can't help but feel lost in the game. For example, Den Defense seemed new, so did the bombs and new (almost unbeatable) enemies, but I never really got to understanding them all, because there was way too much detail put into them to simply easily comprehend. It would've been good if the story missions didn't endlessly tempt you. The music from Jesper Kyd was great as always, though. I really had a problem with the characters on Ezio's story, they seemed very temporary. And on Altair's side.. I don't understand what happened to his voice. He used to have that calm American accent VA which was kind of a screw-up at first, but since they decided to make him speak in an Arabic accent this time, I could barely even recognize it was the same person. It would've been better if he just spoke the same way as before, would've brought some minor nostalgia.Overall, this game is just too clunky for me to be considered good. It's like they put Brotherhood into a pile of mud, then into a blender, and slowly cooked the resulting mass into what Revelations is now..",

So it goes for Ezio Auditore, who finally steps aside to make room for new champions in Assassin's Creed Revelations. The game sets you loose in a visually stunning recreation of 15h Century Constantinople, where you leap across rooftops like a renaissance superhero. But like many sequels, Assassin's Creed Revelations has many flaws. You lose horses and other serious improvements in the last game in favor of awkward mechanics that don't belong. Those include first person plat forming and tower defense battles. Neither of which are very good. Thankfully when Assassin's Creed Revelations remembers to be an Assassin's Creed game, it reminds you of what makes this series so great. Assassin's Creed Revelations isn't all about Ezio Auditore's story, it's also Desmond Mile's story. Here Desmond Mile's mind is a prisoner within the animus. This computerized space is presented as an island. Where shimmering doors leads to his ancestor's memories as well as his own. Playing as Desmond Miles isn't as entertaining as is it was in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. That's due in part to the levels that represent his memories. This synthetic cyberspace environments are a cool backdrop but the gameplay isn't fun. You create blocks and ramps out of thin air and move forward, but the jumping feels flat and the puzzles don't test your mind, they are just frustrating. This is one of Assassin's Creed Revelations attempt to force elements into a game that doesn't benefit from them. Unfortunately, you spend the bulk of your time as Ezio and sometimes as Altair from Assassin's Creed 1. It seems it's near the games conclusion throb with emotional resonance. Yes, there are a few great holy cow moments near the end, but it's the calm before the storm that tides two lives together and thus impresses the most. It makes you realize you will miss these Assassins of centuries past. As for Ezio Auditore's story, it's as tired as the older Ezio looks. Great voice actors sell every line, but the political intrigue among the Sultan's family just isn't that interesting. Still Assassin's Creed Revelations largely impresses thanks to how much fun it is to move through its' world. That's partly because of the gorgeous views. It's partly because of the fantastic soundtrack. But it's also because it's climbing and leaping is so joyful. The addition of the hook blade enhances the parkour of past games. You can climb faster, glide down zip lines and grab walls you would have missed in the past. You can also float downwards with parachutes. The result, plat forming is exhilarating as ever and certain set piece missions, like one in which you escape a burning boat ramp up the excitement. Not every set piece moment is as good as that one. Avoiding rocks as you drag behind a curating carriage isn't fun for example. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood did these kinds of scripted events better albeit Assassin's Creed Revelations does make important improvements. Assassin recruitment returns, but sending your brothers and sisters on missions now has more context. Setting Assassins to different cities reduces Templar control and increases Assassins control. The simple addition of a strategic element keeps recruitment from being simple busy work. In addition, there are quests you do with fully leveled assassins. Now, you actually feel like a mentor. An addition that isn't so good is that of tower defense. You capture Templar regimes, by killing commanders and lighting signal fires, but the Templars will try to get them back which means having to play a boring tower defense game. You stand on a roof, assign assassins to different locations and try to defeat waves of enemies. The simple mechanic structure make this a dull exercise and the camera close-ups of falling Templars disrupt the flow. Tower defense isn't all that's new. Now you can craft bombs out of ingredients you find. Combine them at a crafting station and viola. Bombs that explode release poison gas and so on. Combat has seen other changes such as awesome new finishing moves in addition of enemy gunners. Multiplayer returns as well, with some new modes like death match and capture the flag variant. Death match doesn't have the attention that the returning modes do. It's still more enjoyable to sling through the crowds, blending in while hoping your target slips up and makes himself known. Artifact assault gives you a chance to speed across rooftops with the enemies flag, which is quite fun. But, Assassin's Creed Revelations is at its best when it focuses on what the series does best. The first person puzzling and tower defense are bewildering additions, but when you skyrocket across the rooftops of this magnificent city, the stunning sites transport you to another century. Remember, \"Nothing is true... Everything is permitted\". \"La shai wak'ion motlaq bal kollon momken\". I would give this game a rating of 84 out of 100.",

While it's not revolutionary by far it improves on it's predecessors and delivers an interesting story in a rich and superbly designed environment.The story this times takes place in Constantinople and ties all loose ends. Apart from writing the final chapter for Ezio it also revisits Altair who is also a playable character in certain chapters. And it was great to learn what happened to Altair and how both he and Ezio are tied together. The cut scenes are really nicely put together and the whole story is quite interesting.Visually it's also an improvement although not breath taking. The characters are better animated, the environment is well designed and does remind of life teaming city packed with a lot of people. The map overall might be a bit smaller but it's so well designed that it's an actual improvement over the somewhat empty spaces we could encounter in the previous installments. I must admit the city - the way it looks, the way it's structured and how you move around it is what probably makes it my favourite Assassin's Creed game.The mechanics for the most part are the same. With just the addition of bombs which are quite annoying to craft and not that useful and the hook which lets you climb higher places and also zip line which is super fun - the rest almost unchanged. The whole structure of the game remains the same. And it's absolutely fine as you get to do them in a great environment.Overall as mentioned - definitely my favourite Assassin's Creed game. Though somewhat requires you to play the previous ones to fully appreciate the story it ties up. Can't recommend enough.",

There are no interesting characters, memorable chips or moments, too, only **** bombs sell, although they are not needed at all, there is management, but there is no sense in it, there is little equipment, it all opens only when passing each Chapter, you can buy different buildings, but it does not give anything and it is not interesting to do, plus it is very expensive. The only value of this part is the story of Altair and the way he came. It is sad that it is disgusting at the same time that Altair finished like this, although he lived to old age, there was a wife, children, faith, but...people is rotten, the order and with it the faith and commitment of those people who put everything to him. Oh Yes, and the ending is complete nonsense, but Ezio himself, who in part 2 was a young and cheerful boy, here turned into someone else,although one advantage it has that I did not become a slave to Apple and in the whole man he is not bad.Одна из всех серии игр которая вообще не зацепила. Все происходит на одной локации, побежал 500 метров для того чтобы взять задание, выполнил его, беги опять метров 300-500 и так всю игру. Персонажей интересных нет, запоминающихся фишек или моментов тоже, только сраные бомбы впаривают, хотя они и вовсе не нужны, есть менеджмент, но смысла в нем нет, экипировки мало, вся она открывается только при прохождении каждой главы, можно покупать разные здания, но это ничего не дает и этим неинтересно заниматься, плюс это очень дорого. Единственная ценность этой части, это история Альтаира и то как он кончил. Грустно мерзко одновременно, что Альтаир вот так закончил, хоть и дожил до преклонных лет, была жена, дети, вера, но...люди прогнили, орден а вместе с ним и вера и стремление тех людей которые положили для него все. Ах да еще и концовка полный бред, но и сам Эцио, который во 2 части был молодым и веселым мальчуганом, здесь превратился в кого -то другого,хотя один плюс он имеет, что не стал рабом яблока и в целом человек он не плохой.",

The game won't recognize my joystick and it wouldn't do me any good if it did since I \"only\" have 10 buttons at my disposal and the app requires, like, 30. Devs should have stuck with the good old formula \"the less is more\". Instead, we got a game where one must use mouse cursor just to make the character face the other way (?!?!). Long story short, control inputs have ruined what might have been a great game. Since it can't even be played properly, the score of zero would be more appropriate but I'll reward it with one solely on account of nice art-style and the fact I loved the first game.",

You need to think really carefully what you do with your heroes and what weapon you choose against a specific enemy. Nowadays, there are hardly any games like this one - games that demand from player to use his brain and not to just randomly hit keys like in AAA titles and spam an enemy to death. It won't work in here so any average triple A game fan might get lost in here.What I think is the best in the game is difficulty curve, which makes it real and competitive through all the gameplay. You can't just create immortal team of super-hero characters with legendary weapons all -around that hack and slash through everything. Every man in your team is a living being that can get killed just like any other man if you get a little too careless in a dangerous situation. This aspect of the game makes many fights puzzles where you have to think what to do; wheather to make a spear wall formation against dire wolves or take strategic advatnage of terrain and place your soldiers on grass tiles in a swampy area just to make the enemy come there and ... get stuck swamp.Economy is also nicely done as it gives you some options to earn money; you can either sell loot from defeated foes; trade certain goods in specific areas for bigger profit or get quest rewards. Generally, if you think you will have no economic problems in here.If you like to use brain in games and think of fights like of puzzles and you are looking for a virtual challenge then this game is for you.",

Like with Darkest Dungeon, not every fight can be won and RNG is RNG. Sometimes you need to run away to save yourself. I guess some people can't handle that aspect of the game, just like some people can't handle Darkest Dungeon or the X-COM series.The game has over a 92% positive review score on Steam. Don't allow some people who are sour that they can't spam \"X\" to win at the game and upset that they actually have to do some tactical thinking keep you from giving a great indie game a try.",

I think the endgame stuff (132 days) is designed to kill a handful of your veteran's (In my current save I have to take on 15 undead legionaries with necrosavants, honor guard, and undead priests in a god damn swamp)  and I get it your trying to make it gritty, but if you give the player no/very limited options to recoup than its an arbitrary middle finger and turns an otherwise fun game into an arbitrary frustrating waste of time. \"Rocks fall everyone dies\" in other words.TL:DR its gritty low fantasy XCOM set in medieval not Europe, with same intrinsic problems late game XCOM has.",

Despite much player feedback, devs are not responsive and slow to implement measures to allow for EASIER replacement of your men, which will allow for their death to be NOT SO FRUSTRATING (measure such as buying level with gold).Just this 1 con makes the game EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING (the MOST FRUSTRATING RNG game ever).

(Just write some more text I mean... can't be that hard to write text events guys)Cons: Too short, Gets too easy very fast when you get metal armor, Events are poorly done and way too short, leaves you with a \"meh\" feeling overall which is a shame because it had potential. It has no endgame at all... none. So don't expect to get more than a week out of it.I'll just say the game started out strong then suddenly the difficulty fell off a cliff and everything got boring very fast. The worst was when the late game event started (orc invasion) I thought \"oh man things are going to get crazy now\". Nah still pretty boring. Then suddenly 30 game days later the war was suddenly over and some soldiers passing me on the road from a faction I was strongly allied with (and killed oh I dunno a hundred or so orcs for) called me a wuss and I was given the option to fight them or retire (LOL ok) so I chose to fight them and the friggin game won't even let you do that... Also a 30 day orc war!? Really only 30 days!? Laaaaaame! Why would you shoot your endgame in the foot like that? Even if I wanted to hit the \"continue onward anyway\" button they made this stupid level 11 cap for all the mercs. Why? There's no point in continuing the game anyway after the orc invasion because other events just don't happen and by that time you're overpowering everyone with heavy armor anyway. The game woon't even let you imagine that there's endgame content because there's no treasure hunts for unique weapons even worse the unique weapons you do find are the most boring underwhelming things I've ever seen... that's just laziness IMO. I'm sorry but this game is completely lacking in actual content after less than a week of gameplay.",

Somewhere between Expedition Conquistador, Battle for Wesnoth and Jagged Alliance.Pros:- the game is very \"atmospheric\", it portrays the cruelty of real battles (well, at least as much as you are allowed to do that in a mass-market medium like games).. E.g. the faces of soldiers get scarred and bruised as they take damage- the dialogs and texts are very well written and are interesting to read- the 2D graphics style with pawn-like soldiers actually works pretty well. It's great how, without any animations of soldiers, the battles still look nice. There are many faces in the game and they basically carry this game's whole visual style- a solid system of character upgrades, items etc - this reminded me JA2 the most- the world is randomly generated!So-so:- the utter randomness of everything. Most attacks are done at 30-50% hit chance, even when you are on a tile next to the target. Sigh.. I know all the argument about why RPGs have randomness but I'm a continental European, not an American or British, so I strongly prefer games without fog of war and no dice rolls. So, this game is NOT a strategy game, it's an RPG. If you like RPGs more than strategy you will love it, but if you're more into strategy you may find yourself replaying the same battle and getting vastly different results from basically the same tactics, which, to me, turns myself into some kind of a passive observer rather than active decision-maker. On the other hand, you can see this randomness as just the \"realism\". I mean, as a mercenary you can die any moment, even if you are very experienced and have all the best armor etc. Btw to prevent save scamming you can't save during battles.Cons:- (nitpicking) no tutorial, instead they have 2 videos on youtube (1 about combat, the other about the world map and party management) which I did find pretty well done. However, I'd prefer an offline tutorial. Without watching the videos, some game rules can't be easily guessed and will make your first experience very frustrating. E.g. if you archer is in melee range (1 tile) from an enemy, you can't retreat because the enemy unit gets a free attack. And not just but also if that attack hits then your move is cancelled! Such unusual stuff definitely requires a proper tutorial at game start.To me, if one could replace hit chances with damage multipliers (e.g. instead of having a 50% chance to hit you would just do 50% of damage but always hit etc) I'd love this game! Maybe this could even be done by editing the config files somewhere, no idea. Probably not though, since these chance-to-hit calculations are spread throughout the whole game, with a multitude of other factors tied to them.",

Not all of them work, but the designers are obviously experienced gamers.The biggest strike I would call attention to is that it plays a bit like a card or board game. These are casual experiences, designed to be completed in a couple of hours, so high risk game play works well. Not so well for computer games. In Battle Brothers, the risk to your crew is always very high and the time investment to develop your crew members is also very high (many, many hours of play). I think these two elements are not compatible. Being forced to recruit inexperienced cripples is a design idea that really does not work.Beyond the German setting, the structure of the game is reminiscent of an old classic called Darklands. Other people have noticed this as well. My opinion is that they should study this older game to help influence the evolution of this title a) because they are closely related in concept, b) because this game needs much more depth to reach its (lofty!) potential, and c) because Darklands was fantastic for its time and needs to be revisited.I really wish Overhype Studios well on this fine foundation. Triple A could be in their future.As a final note: Although the writer is talented, and I don't wish to insult him, his sense of humor needs to be weaned out the game. Monty Python-esque humor is very hard to do well. It is PhD level comedy ... not for the amateurs. I feel that the weak humor detracts from the play experience. The writer also ventures into inappropriate and obscene humor. This is not as widely acceptable as the current media would have you think. I feel this should be avoided.",

                  "Comment": "            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Battle Brother is a game which worth its price.Context :You are the new leader of a medieval warband due to the former captain's death against bandits. You will recruit, equip, level and eventually burry your battle brothers during your travels in a world randomly generated at each new game, between the icy lands of the north to south's sandy beaches passing throw swamp and dark forests.In each worldmap (Mount&Blade like), most of human cities and settlements are ruled by three noble houses, some are also independent, but all will offer you contracts more or less difficult to complete to earn reputation and gold.These contracts are very differents from one another, from caravan escort to orcish fights or graveyard exploration, on tacticals map depending on your location (forest, swamp, snow...).The combat system is very intuitive and tactical, specially recommended for those who like turn-based strategic games (like X-com but less inmersive).Your actions will determine your reputation. Will you be a cruel bandit or a noble mercenary ? Will you flee from battle to fight another day or die with honour ?Visual :See screenshots. The team's graphist is very talented. Arts are excellents and immerse player into game. I love style and textures, and specifically the days and nights effects traducing the time of the day from dawn to dust and vice versa.Audio :Just beautiful. Each ennemie has few specific musics.So with some experience you will know who is ambushing you just by listening ;)Gameplay :On the worldmap, if not paused, time is spending continuously during your actions (travel, camp, repairs, heal) with very nice visual effects. Your main job will be to take contracts, one contract at a time, in towns, castle and cities. Contracts are missions with a narrative context which if you take time to read, generate sometimes shivers or laughs. Suceed and will earn notorioty, gold and upgrade relationship with settlements.Gold is usefull to buy goods, food for your men, equip and heal them.Good relationship enables you to decrease marchant prices. Eventually a bad one will may end in a fight.Notorioty influence events ends or possibilities. Events are triggered depending on your action, the background of your men, their level, randomly... I let you discover those which are a good part of Battle Brother's richness.With all that you will mostly fight to level your men (if they survive) against abundance of ennemies (orcs, gobelins, bandits, knights, undead, ...). Each ennemy faction has its own tactics in battle and you'll have to adapt and prepare your men consequently. It is a nice challenge : panel of weapons, armors and skills will be the key to do so.Most of the time you will decide when and where you'll fight but not always due to night or surprise attack or ambush. Last but not least there are some dungeons to explore with legendary item as reward.As there is no really end to the game, as long as you survive, it's really great to play countless hours with the men you trained from their beginning to the mighty knight or agile bowman he has became (and you may cry their death).Cons :- Band limited, you will not able to rule a castle or manage anything different than your own warband.- No horses in a medieval game (wtf? ;).Pros :+ Very conscientious Devs listening to the community.+ Interesting skills-tree to develop your own tatics.+ Various ennemies (humans, beasts, greenskins, undead).+ Various armor, weapons, goods to trade or craft and more.+ No-end campaign or retire when you want (except premature death ;).+ Each game is unique.+ Donkeys !To conclude, Battle Brothers' world is mainly unexplored, dark and full of terrors. If you like the visual and turn based tactical game with a deep RPG immersion do not hesitate.",

The story takes about 5 hours to finish, which is a little quick but including the collectables, 10 mini kits, one blacksmith recipe, and three treasures a mission, plus the red bricks for quests giving you special abilities will add tons of hours onto it. There's not to much wrong with this game except for the few glitches that happened to me in the middle of missions where I couldn't get out of a space and made me restart the mission. I also wish there were checkpoints, since in some missions mini kits spawn in places where if you miss it there's no going back.

I wish they had provided the option to turn off the voices.They added some new features to the game but I think they detract more than they add.  TT has added yet another set of collectibles that allow you to...do nothing but get more collectibles.  This is tied to the side quest concept.  Neither of these do anything for the game other than extend its length.  The quests aren't fun and don't move the story forward.  Some of the collectible items are suppose to be useful (allow you to use a single char with all the abilities) but some of the key abilities still cannot be obtained without using certain characters.  This was a half-hearted implementation and does nothing for the game.Fortunately there were no vehicles in this game (because TT has never gotten them right).  But they replaced that will yet more jumping puzzles that test your patience.  If you don't jump at the right time you lose the puzzle.  Losing the puzzle means starting all over again.  Some puzzles can take minutes to complete.  TT does anybody there actually evaluate how much time you are wasting of gamers' times because of these crappy puzzles?  If they were straightforward then this would be a different scenario but often times the camera angle changes, you have to switch characters (which is messed up), jump at just the right time or a series of other actions that cause failure.  The jumping puzzles aren't fun.  I remember when Lego games were for younger kids.  I doubt most 8 yr olds could easily complete them now.Changing chars is painful in this game.  You really have to understand what is going on or you can mess things up.  If you \"quick\" select a char from the radial and that char is already on the screen (either the second controller char or because of story mode) then you switch from the first to the second char's location.  If you're in the middle of a puzzle you just got screwed.  If you use the full roster screen or the char is not visible then the current char switches.  This leads you down the path of always using the full roster just to be safe.  The problem with the full roster is that, especially with timed events, it is slower and can take a while to get the char you want.All in all this game attempts to move the Lego games forward but I think it actually takes them a step back.  I hope voices, the horrible jumping puzzles and odd char selection behavior don't make their way into the next Lego game.  This isn't the worse of the serious but it is nowhere near the best.  Bring us back the fun Lego games TT!!!",

Graphically it's good, but as it is a lego game, there is naturally only so much that can be done. The game re-creates accurately scenes from the movie, and even contains nods to characters that only fans of the book would know. This is by no stretch of the imagination a challenging game, it's very casual, but that is what the game is aimed at being, and it is not ashamed, or trying to disguise this. My only complaint, is that i found the controlls to be actually a little difficult to get used to; aka, the item/character selection wheel, and i'm a 22 year old adult. So if i struggle a little, a child might lose his patience.",

Other thing is when playing alone your secondary character rarely helps out and usually just stands there. So you have to control the second character too. It's a bit odd considering in the other Lego games the secondary character was automatic. Overall though, the game fantastically captures the spirit of The Lord of the rings.",

After completing the story in approximately 45 hours over the span of 4 months (march~july) and spending a lot more with quests and extra \"post-game things\" to do (no spoilers~), I have to thoroughly admit that this game is something that all RPG fans should play! Now, is it as good as EOIV? Let's see the goods and bads before comparing the two.The Goods: Etrian Odyssey Untold is a freshened, remade version of the first game, which was released around 6/7 years ago (2007). It has a story mode, and the story mode serves as the main mode that etrian players will play. The classic mode is still there for people who want to use their own crew for fighting....and stuff. So, down to the story mode - it's surprisingly great. I found the premise of the story to be a bit niche, but the way they presented it was really spectacular, and the scripting was as good as ever, convincing me to continue to play it until the end. It was really emotional towards the end and I have to applaud Atlus for being able to shake my iron soul. The graphics are as good as ever for a 3DS game, and the 3D effect is really well implemented, as always. The character designs are really nice, and the backgrounds are really detailed and well drawn. The music was something from another planet. Yuzo Koshiro really did a splendid job remastering the songs from the first game into an orchestrated/live version of it for this game. I never turned the volume down or turned off the BGM throughout the whole time, and actually kept it at max volume while keeping the others down. You see, there are FOEs (strong bosses that roam the labyrinth) that cruise around, keeping you scared and alert, and they are really programmed well this game. The puzzles that you have to solve to avoid fighting them is really well designed, and some of the later stratums require a lot of thinking to avoid these nasty fights. The fighting system is as good as ever, with the inclusion of Grimoire Stones, which from what I know..are stones that contain enemy's (or human) skills that can be used if the weapon type is the same as the user......which can be confusing, but you'll learn more about it ingame~. The dungeons are wonderful as ever, the feeling you get from mapping is splendid, and the 3 difficulties you get from the beginning of the game are great for beginners and veterans (I chose the standard diff, fyi). The bosses are really tough, most of the time, and things get really intense, again, towards the end of the game. Definitely worth the effort of grinding~The Neutral: It's good that voice acting has been implemented more, but it may be nicer if more things were spoken. I felt that they only spoke 1 or 2 important lines in central parts of the story, and not really talking much in other \"branches\" of the story that I also felt were somewhat important. Again, although it's something that has never occurred in the franchise, I have always thought that a city hub would be nice (one that you could explore), but it seems you'll be stuck with menus for this game as well, which isn't exactly a problem. Another neutral thing is the grinding at the start of the game. You're really going to have to spend a bit of time (although it's easier in this game) grinding for a while to get a decent load of cash and skills/levels. The game is also a tad bit to the boring side for the first 10-20 hours, and after that - things really get awesome and super intense! (especially the story, but you'll have to wait it out for a while)The Bad: There isn't really much here that I can say...though there is one thing I can think of. It'd be nice if the game had more than 1 slot for saving, because after finishing story mode, I wanted to try Classic mode but I didn't want to delete my old file, so it kinda creates a problem for people like me who want to try out everything that's featured in the game without deleting anything.VS EOIV and Overall: Compared to EOIV, I'd say this is a better game to start with, but notice that it's definitely more difficult than EOIV - especially with endgame bosses and the last few stratums being very very difficult to beat and navigate through (and map). Although EOIV has the wonderful world system (\"Lands\") and Untold lacks it, I'd say that Untold still holds pretty well with EOIV. Of the two though, I'd say I like EOIV more by only a small percentage. I truly had a great experience with EO Untold, and hopefully this review can sway you (hopefully and RPG fan) to have the wonderful experience that I had whilst playing this game~Gameplay: 10/10Story: 9/10Music: 10/10Presentation: 9/10Length/PostGame: 9/10Overall: 9/10",

Etrian Odyssey is a game series based on exploration and preparing. One false step, one missed hit and its the end for you.The overall game is very much enjoyable. The graphics, mainly Anime-style, are very well drawn and you have a whole variety of them. About 4 for each class and additional ones for specific characters and NPCs.As you enter the game you are greeted with a beautiful sounding soundtrack that expands on the whole Labyrinth you will explore. However having played the original, the remakes just don't sound as good. They are still quite good though.And now we are already at the part that I love about this game. Everyone who has played this knows about the end of the game. Well \"end\". The big Twist about this game to be specific. And that is where the two new modes come into play. I myself already know the secrets and know whats coming for me but seeing how the characters in the story mode discover it for them-self makes it even better. It is like a Anime that you have to play along to unlock more and more the further you get. But of course the Story mode has a lot more to offer than the actual old classic mode. New maps, new quests and most importantly: New areas.This comes into play as I hear many people moaning about the fact that this game does not have a Over-world map. Correct me if I am wrong but I am pretty sure that the Over-world map came with later installments of the series. And as of right now I am very happy about the fact that they did not make a Over-world map. I see though where an Over-world map could come into play. it just wouldn't fit.If you want a challenging and interesting game to play than Etrian Odyssey, the series as a whole (except the Mystery Dungeon Spin-off) is a game you should play.",

It was a lot of fun and i loved  the map making, which is supposedly a big part of the series. I think the combat skill tree system wasn't that hard to grasp, and i like how character stats only showed up when purchasing items, so it was overall simple. I wish the combat was a little more engaging, however. It kind of reminded me of digimon dusk and dawn's combat, because the characters were doing amazing things but all you saw was bursts of fire and squares shaking as they took damage. I wasn't expecting pokemon X and Y grade combat graphics, but I feel, especially since the story had fixed players they could model, they could have made a few general animations for when they attacked, even if they were simple like what the enemy monsters did. I like the first person, but it felt weird to have a main character that felt apart of me and separate from me at the same time. The dialogue options didn't normally change the story, but allowed a little humour here and there. However, i couldn't fully feel like it was me adventuring with the others, but rather me controlling the main character. When i get this feeling, i don't wish i had more control. I wish the main character had more character of his own. Finally, the grimuar stones (probably spelled that wrong, though) were a nice feature that was apparently new, but i think they could have simplified it. If i forgot to edit my stones after a few trips back from the forest, i would suddenly find 20 or more new stones and feel overwhelmed. Perhaps they could have made it so i could extract skills individually and recycle ones i didn't want to level up skills i wanted to keep, that way my only question was which skills i wanted, not which stone i wanted to make.

The classic mode isSo you will know what type of gamer is writing this review, I'll list three of my favorite games. Danganronpa Fire EmblemAtelier TotoriFirstly, you should know this review is of the story mode, not the classic mode. For those who don't know, this game has two modes to choose from when starting a game. The story mode is the one with a plot and voice acting. The classic mode is choosing your teams jobs from the start, unlike the story mode where you are given a party of five members and can only change their class after reaching level thirty. THE BAD: I found the ending to be disappointing in my opinion. It felt rushed and was very short. Changing your class in story mode does not change the portrait of the character. So, if you change a defender to mage or whatever else, the picture will still show the defender turned mage still holding a shield and sword. Now, this isn't a major gripe of mine but I just wanted to mention it because it was one of the reasons I didn't change classes. THE GOOD:MUSIC: The music was awesome. From slow piano to roaring guitar solo, it's in this game. I found myself nodding my head to some of the battle music.GRAPHICS: Graphics are good for 3DS. The dungeons are each unique, dessert, sea, forest, jungle, demolished city, it's all there. The dungeons were. nice to look at. Nothing ugly to say the least. GAMEPLAY: The battle system is turn based and quite fun. Also,the level up system is great. Every time you gain a level, you get a point to distribute to a skill or Stat boost. So you can take your character in the direction you want to. Well, no heavy knight combined mage, but still. I felt it was very nicely done. VOICE ACTING: The voice acting is great as well. Even Chie's voice actor from Persona 4 is in this game. STORY: The dialogue wasn't overly childish as many other games I have played have been. The story was good. Just the ending was disappointing because it was too short. CLOSING COMMENTS:I would recommend this game to anyone who is a hard core RPG gamer. Bear in mind this is a dungeon crawler and it's not for everyone. There were times when I would get slightly nauseated from the dungeon crawling. This isn't unusual for an RPG though but definently expect it from dungeon crawlers. Also note, if you are an adult and are looking for a more mature dungeon crawler, then check out Demon Gaze and Dungeon Travelers 2 for the PS Vita.That wraps it up, hope it helps.",

I just don't think I'll ever be compelled to finish it. 20 hours at this price before losing interest for another game isn't bad.",

Why? Partly because it was the first good game I've actually played. When I first got a Nintendo 64 I was considerably young, and yet every game I played I thought was absolutely horrible. All I had were simple objective games, and as a child I thought they were hard and pointless. Then one day Ocarina of Time was brought home and I at first refused to play it. So I watched my father play it for a while, and straight away it was something entirely new and different. Also at the time, it was the most real (to me at least). What brought me in was the ability to actually explore and get to know people, even if the people you talked to all repeated the same things over and over no matter how many times you talked to them, but it didn't matter. This game was something new and exciting to me, and to this day I get this good old nostalgic feeling whenever I play it. It has one of the greatest stories of all time for a video game and was one of the first to create its own sort of universe and it was one of the first 3D environment game where you can see in all 360 degrees (after Mario 64 that is). Plus to this day people are still discovering new secrets to the game and so many in-depth theories arise from this title alone based upon this game that keep it interesting. The characters feel like characters and the visuals are some of the most cinematic of its time. The gameplay is also very fun, which of course is one of the most important things and there are very involving puzzles that are simple enough in appears but very complex when you get down to it. There is so much that I could say about this game, but sometimes even looking back, I'm at a loss of words at how awesome this game is.",

Every area you explore from the moment you wake up in the lush and green forest of the Kokiri to the vast and deep desert of the Gerudos' is crafted to perfection. The combat system in Ocarina was also a shining star. Not only did weapons feel right, react well, and play out perfectly, but they were always interesting and had their own advantages. Not once did a weapon outshine another because they all had a great purpose. The Z-Targeting system was added for a more cinematic feel that worked flawlessly and it even made combat easier and more interesting. The music and sounds of the game brought it to life as well. Every area had it's own theme music that was unique to that zone and always felt right and gave the player that more personal feeling wherever he/she went. Kokiri Forest felt like a wonderful place of happiness while Hyrule Field had an epic and powerful tone to it. The addition of musical gameplay made things more interesting as well and showed an importance to every area the player visited. Now, most importantly to the Zelda series itself and to any video game for that matter, comes the story. The Legend of Zelda has always been a series shining in the glory of it's adventures and this was the biggest and most powerful of them all. You begin as a young boy who has always felt left out and who has nightmares of dark visions that would become realities. As you start your quest you realize your true destiny and embark on a journey filled with adventure and courage like no other. The dark king of the Gerudo's Gannondorf seeks the legendary Triforce and will stop at nothing to rule the land of Hyrule. By unleashing monsters from the Temples' of Hyrule and by turning the once good and just land to pure evil, Gannondorf attempts total rule over the world. Link being the Hero of Hyrule must journey to the different lands and temples' of the land in order to gain power from the mystical \"sages\" and stop Gannondorf. The story in Ocarina beings great and never lets go. In fact the game gets better every second that it progresses. You meet many interesting characters such as Princess Ruto, Malon, Darunia, and the mysterious Sheik that not only have their own individual traits, but also contain important roles in your quest. Also, each character is easily remembered and full of emotion which grasps the player and gives them a sense of caring and passion for each one. The many temples and dungeons visited during the game are all fun, unique, and interesting and reward the player as he/she progresses. The game has quite a few side quests that are entertaining and it follows through right up to the end. There is nothing negative about this game and to this day it stands on a pedestal as one of if not the greatest game of all time and for good reason. Since it's release very few games have captured the true story, art, and power Ocarina of Time had mastered back in 1998. To this day I myself still play it and still consider it my favorite game ever. Not because of great graphics, or online play, or anything else that current games have fallen into but because Zelda is a game that touched my heart like no other game ever has. Current game developers and enthusiasts need to look back at The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and reconsider the direction that games are going. Zelda mastered it, and for that we should honor it.",

                  "Comment": "            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game is do doubt the greatest game in existance. Non, except for Nintendo haters, have been able to play this game without admiting it is at least one of the best of the best, if not THE best of the best. Super Mario 64 was the first game to make 3D conversion work, but this was the game that perfected it. It introduced a large 3 dimensional world to explore, which at the time was a huge deal. It also introduced new gameplay mechanics that made the action adventure genre work out even more. Like the lock-on targeting system, which helped to keep your eye on the enemy much easier, but without making the fighting too easy, as you had to meneuver around the enemy and dodge his attacks. Another big new feature was horse-back riding. Riding your horse around the huge field was big and new. It had an engaging story, that really sucked you in, which had lots of twists and turns. Like when Ganondorf attacked the castle, destroying your plan to get the Triforce before Ganon did. Or near the end, when Shiek, the man who helped you on your journey as an adult, reveals himself to be Princess Zelda, the person Link had been searching long and hard for. Another thing was the conversion from Young Link to Adult Link. This was the first Zelda game that introduced Adult Link, making him look more epic, and more like the hero of the legends. But the bigger twist is how you can play as both Young Link and Adult Link. Not only that, but the story counts on you using both of them to make it all the way through the story. There are alot of complicated dungeons with puzzles to solve, which can sometime twist your brain, and make the game much more challenging. What I loved about Zelda was the flawless gameplay and beautiful landscapes. Zelda Ocarina of Time was a first, it brought forth the perfection of 3D conversion, and made it beautiful, but also made the 3D mechanics work with how the game played out, and it worked beautifully. Of course the game isn't perfect, there are a few flaws in Ocarina of Time. Like the Water Temple, which is the most unpopular dungeon in the game. Everyone had a hard time with it, so it proved to be a bit too challenging. Plus in some parts of the game, the graphics don't look good at all. However, these flaws are not severe enough to interfere with the games overall greatness. There may be no such thing as a perfect game, but this game is as close to a perfect game as you can get. Zelda Ocarina of Time won Game of the Year in 1998, and got an honorable award in outstanding gaming achievement in 1999, and it didn't win these awards without good reason. This game is truley the best game of all time, and anyone who thinks they can make a game better than this is absolutely crazy. Sure Ocarina of Time may not be outstanding by todays standards, but considering the technology of gaming at the time, it was the best gaming could offer. Even 13 years after the game came out, Ocarina of Time is still selling like nuts via the Wii Virtual Console, which re-released Ocarina of Time in 2007. In my opinion, Ocarina of Time is, and will always be, the greatest game ever made, and I'm not alone in that statement. I have yet to meet a person who is not a Zelda hater who played Ocarina of Time and thought the games was horrible. Ocarina of Time is the best of the best in gaming, hands down, and it deserves a perfect score more than any game.",

Pros: Beautiful graphics for the N64; subtle, but challenging gameplay; variety of dungeons, puzzles, and secrets; innovative and imaginative. Cons: If Ocarina of Time had faults, it would be its often dull dungeon design, camera issues, and it has one of the worst power-ups to date.",

Does it hold up today? In my personal opinion, it holds up pretty well and was pretty close to perfection. The visuals may look outdated today, but you cannot deny yourself that the atmosphere in the destinations within Hyrule are mesmerizing to explore in this game. The locations, the character designs, the temples, the story and the soundtrack (especially the soundtrack) are absolutely memorable through out this game and this game practically made me became a Zelda fan in the first place. I could see why there are some people whether they are Zelda fans or not that they are too fond with this Zelda title. It's a bit identical to A Link to the Past on the SNES, but with 3D rendered visuals and there is a lack of personality within many characters compared to the later Zelda games where character personalities has improved in. However, for Nintendo to produce an engaging story for their first 3D Zelda game, it became forgivable for its time. This maybe a really overrated Zelda game, but there's a reason why people prefer Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as an instant classic.",

Without a doubt, the back story, plot and setting of the whole game is definitely well made to fit with the story of Hyrule, and the legend that is the Legend Of Zelda series that started on the NES. The battles and triumphs and the twist that splits the series in two, none of it would be possible without Shigeru Myamoto's brilliant mind and logic. The game flourishes in a brilliant Open-world setting, as we gamers agree, the best type of game there is (Grand Theft Auto and LA Noire are examples of Open World Games). Brilliant gameplay, especially being the first 3D Zelda game in which all others based off of, and I think people can have continuous fun hours on end just messing around with the Ocarina lol.",

This game is THE blueprint, not on for Zelda games but any Zelda-inspired game since. The reasons this game is cited as \"The Best Game of All Time\" are many, all of which are accurate. It was really the first game evr to break through what is known as the \"polygon ceiling\". Franchises just couldn't make the jump to 3D correctly, either failing miserably like Bubsy or having to sacrifice something to make the grade meaning those games lost exactly what made the series good (Castlevania is the one that springs to mind here). OoT, however, not only showed everyone how 3D should be done, but how games should be done in general by having a great, fun story with plenty of twists and turns along the way, great controls that were simple to pick up and play and a massive amount of innovations with Z-Targeting being the most prevalent. Enjoyiing that lock-on in any game ever? You have Ocarina to thank for that. The puzzles were brilliant because they showcased the 3D perfectly, making you have to utilise spacial awareness by, for example, standing at a vantage point to fire an arrow through a lit torch so it sets on fire and ignites an extinguished torch at the other end of the room. No 3D game did that, which is why it was the pinnacle of the new revolution. The game is enormous even today, with in-depth side-quests that can easily detract you from the story for hours. Puzzles aren't out of reach for anyone so you don't have to be a genius to carry on with the story. Yes, sometimes the puzzles are more of the same, but that is really all they could do at the time with technology and memory constraints. This game was so big, a GamePak with increased memory was made just for this game, that later on became the standard memory allowance. The music is instantly recognisable and most of the well-known Zelda tracks are from this game, the only main song missing is the Zelda theme at the start instead opting for original music which, while an excellent piece is a little disappointing. Even after a decade, it's still the highest scored game ever on this site and there is a reason for that. This is not just a great Zelda game, but the greatest game of all time. If you haven't played this game in any of it's forms, you can't call yourself a gamer.",

Pretty famous for it's story that keeps you involved at all times, never getting less climactic and leading to a huge pay-off and closure. Dungeon and level design is top notch and so clever they can be learned from even now. So much excellent extra content in exploring, secrets, mini-games and collectables that actually matter and improve your character and enhance the gameplay and is fun to do. Combat has alot of puzzle elements imbedded as well, especially the bosses require finding a solution whilst in the heat of the battle. It's all controlled rather intuitive with the Z-targetting being used for the first time and the handy hotkey buttons for sidegrade  weapons and items. The HUD was also non intrusive and nicely designed for the time. Navigating through the expansive open world and dungeon is made user friendly by the clear map system, has no problems with mulitple floors and levels. The array of gadgets and weapons to your disposal is astounding and let's you find several ways to reach your goal. Still playing it when I need to be reminded what games should strife to be like and I can't help myself but going for all the side content every time getting lost in the world of Hyrule.",

                  "Comment": "            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I am a tiny bit biased, because even with the flaws Revelation has, the ending (at least the first ending, the ending involving Altair and Ezio) makes up for most of them.This is the end of the Ezio-trilogy, and also kinda has a meeting of Ezio and Altair in a way.the new setting, Constantinople, is rather beautiful, even though it ofc looks a bit dated by now.So is Ezio, kinda... he is quite a bit older than he was in previous games, and you start to get the feeling he has aged, is a bit less agile, yet more experienced.The intro already is cool, following in Altairs footsteps into a fortress, followed by a very dramatic almost execution to a wild chase with a carriage, and then the game begins.The system with apprentice assassins you can hire has been elaborated on, and you can establish bases and send your assassins out all over Europe, which will get you mats and money. If needed, you can call your assassins, which makes some fights a bit easier. I really liked this system, just like I did in Brotherhood, it was a nice idea and nicely done, and feels much more \"assassin-like\" than hiring street-thugs in Syndicate.Another new system is a tower-defense like minigame, which I thought feels a bit \"forced into the game\". It was a nice attempt, but I didn't think it fit all that well, so I only did it once (the tutorial, which you have to do to progress the story), and never again... it's pretty much optional.You can craft different kinds of bombs, depending on what you like to use (distract enemies, smoke bombs etc). They elaborated on that, and teach you how to use it in game, and I did use different kinds of bombs, yet didn't think it was a big game-changer. It was another nice attempt to change things around a bit.The hookblade you get early on in the game enables Ezio to do faster climbing, or do wider jumps, plus it can be used in melee. Another small detail, not earth-shattering, but nice, and I liked how it was introduced (a \"trademark tool\" of the assassin-branch in Constantinople, so to say)The story is ok... nothing too amazing, but there are some very cool moments...sneaking into a feast, taking out murderers there, etc.Flaws: I had 2-3 crushes. Also, the game still has the wonky controls the previous games had, where sometimes, things you try end up in a mishap... jumps not working, you ejecting yourself off a wall instead of climbing up, stopping instead of quickly climbing an obstacle etc.This made one optional race (against a potential apprentice you can hire) INCREDIBLY frustrating, as there was ZERO room for errors in that race, so I gave up and never hired that guy. No problem though, as you have enough other candidates, and once you level them up, they become useful assistants for taking out tougher enemies quickly.If you played AC II and Brotherhood, you might remember the optional \"imba armour riddles\". In those games, you could unlock legendary armour sets (AC II: Altairs armour, BH: Brutus' armour and dagger). There is something like that here, but this time, it's rather simple to get. YOu need to find a few items hidden in the city (you can use a guide to find these). In order to get to one of them, you need to get to sequence 4 or 5 in the story to unlock a part of the city... once you do, you can get all missing pieces, do a jumping-puzzle and unlock a legendary armour-set.It was nice and made things a bit easier, but it didn't feel like an achievement really, compared to the equivalents in earlier games. Much easier and you can do it early on.The ending... what an iconic moment. I loved how it brought closure to the story of Ezio and Altair. I really liked the sequences where you played as Altair. He looked better than in AC 1, and you had the more modern handling. The sequences with him were tricky, sometimes quite difficult but that didnt bother me, as I simply loved how you were alternating between Ezio and Altair and brought their story to an end (or almost an end in Ezios case)One thing truly sucked: After you complete that story, you go back to the present, and there is another too-long, no-room-for-errors-jumping puzzle. At that point, I thought I had beaten the game and hated having to play another jumping-puzzle, needing several attempts to beat it. Same thing in AC3: Too much of an afterthought there, and after the totally cool, very epic and movie-like end of Ezios part (the chase and final fight), this felt tagged-on, unnecessary and anti-climatic.So: Its a bit buggy, it feels a TINY bit uninspired, some things were unnecessary (tower defense) or too easy (legendary armour), but at the same time, it was a great change of scenery, had some killer sequences (intro etc.), brought closure to 2 of the coolest assassins and, even with its flaws is a fun game, especially since you can probably get it cheap these days. If you liked ACII and BH and can get this for a few bucks, definitely consider it!",

While on the surface this game may seem similar to – indeed, even improved from its predecessors, the game suffers from a weak plot and repetitive gameplay relative to the previous games.StoryEzio Auditore is graying, but he hasn’t slowed down yet. AfterAssassin’s Creed Revelations is a third person parkour/stealth game, and the third in the Assassin’s Creed II trilogy of games. While on the surface this game may seem similar to – indeed, even improved from its predecessors, the game suffers from a weak plot and repetitive gameplay relative to the previous games.StoryEzio Auditore is graying, but he hasn’t slowed down yet. After travelling to the fortress of Altair, the assassin protagonist from the original Assassin’s Creed, in search of answers, he is confronted by a group of Templars who are searching for five keys that could open up Altair’s vault and give them access to the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact left behind by Those Who Came Before that can reveal many secrets and control men’s minds, among other things. Ezio must find the keys before them so that he can keep the artifact safe.Alas, this game’s plot is quite poor compared to the previous games; the plot is motivated entirely by a “collect the soup cans” plot, where you try and collect the magical keys before the bad guys do. The cast is all new, with only Ezio appearing from the previous two Assassin’s Creed II games, and while there are flashbacks to Altair’s life in the aftermath of the original Assassin’s Creed, having never played the first game, I’m not sure to what extent some of the characters are carried over from that game.The biggest problem lies in the fact that the modern-day plot – the entire reason that Desmond, the protagonist, is flashing back through his ancestor’s memories – takes an extreme back seat throughout the game. Desmond spends the entire game trapped in the machine that allows him to view his ancestor’s memories, and thus the meta-plot comes to a screeching halt and the whole game feels like a pointless cash-in, something which Ubisoft created to exploit AC II once more before finally releasing AC III. While the meta-plot never consumed a huge fraction of the previous games, its absence here is very notciable, as Ezio’s story just isn’t that interesting or high-stakes, and none of the characters I encountered in Constantinople connected with me in any way. The whole “conspiracy theory” angle that the previous games had is almost entirely lost, with no real signs of said gigantic conspiracy appearing in the game, and without that whole aspect, the game is simply much less interesting.GameplayThe gameplay is virtually unchanged from the previous Assassin’s Creed II games. Ezio starts out with all his toys, and he only really gets a couple new ones – a hook that he can use to extend his reach while jumping, which is vaguely interesting for some platforming, and bombs, which have a variety of effects, but the main one is basically “win fights even more ridiculously easily than before.” There were a few acrobatic maneuvers added to close combat, but they’re mostly pretty worthless; combat is extremely easy and I never even once had to use the new maneuvers to win or escape.The gameplay is still the same formula as the previous Assassin’s Creed II games: you spend the whole game running through a city, climbing buildings and occasionally murdering people. The parkour is pretty smooth, but honestly has begun to wear a bit thin; while it is neat being able to climb buildings, in the end it is mostly just following paths through the environment which mostly feel extremely straightforward and without much skill. Because Ezio does so much automatically, there’s very little challenge in the platforming aspects of the game, and because Ezio is so good at instantly killing enemies – indeed, he can kill every enemy in the game with a single hit, and oftentimes, kill entire groups in this manner – there’s very little challenge in combat. The main challenge of the game is sneaking around stealthily, and a few missions where you aren’t supposed to kill people, but even all of that is easily done within a couple tries.Consequently, the game as a whole feels extremely lightweight, and there isn’t much of a sense of achievement in victory; everything feels like it was handed to you on a silver platter, and the lack of challenge makes a lot of the game feel samey. A few underground tombs add some variety to the feel of the game, and a few of them felt pretty good, but in the end they really more or less boil down to “running along the path and the game trying to make it look impressive”, rather similar to the 3D Sonic games, but without the challenge. The missions can almost all be beaten very quickly, and most of the missions that cannot be beaten extremely quickly are because you have to run back and forth across the city. If you were just running through the main quest line, you could beat the entire game in under 10 hours.The main side quests in the game are just “collect all the objects in the environment”, and while there are maps to finding the items which you can purchase, actually grabbing all the items is completely unchallenging; it is just tedious.",

It feels the same as brotherhood, with some unnecessary minigames added and a less engaging story and environment. There also aren't any cool side missions like the ones with Leonardo in Brotherhood.

Revelations is superior to its predecessor in every regard, rivaling AC and AC:2 in what each does best, while doing so much more.The first thing you'll notice about this game is that everything looks much, much better than in Brotherhood. Konstatinople rivals Venice as the most colourful location in any AC game, as do all of the secondary locations. Just as importantly, the city is a pleasure to navigate through, not just visually but also in terms of layout and freerunning paths. The features that allow for Ezio's stunts are not only convenient, but also look natural in their environment. This is something I couldn't say since the original AC.The writing is as good as it has ever been. Unlike Brotherhood, Revelations is story-driven rather than a big collection of purposeless sidequests. Not that there are no sidequests to distract you, but they are much sparser and, frankly, I didn't miss them at all. The storytelling in this game is the richest and most colourful to date. Rather than throwing around faceless characters, just to name-drop a historical figure, AC:R takes a bit of time to develop some likable characters. This title takes it upon itself to patch the AC storyline, which by that point was stretched thin and made less and less sense.I think that a concise background story and motives for Desmond were way overdue.In terms of fighting mechanics, Revelations is a marginal improvement over Brotherhood. Your assassin helpers are not as overpowered, and the use of camera feels less broken than in Brotherhood. Still, it doesn't seem that brilliant mechanics of the original AC will be making a comeback any time soon.Revelations is not without fault. The unbeatable Janissaries that patrol parts of the city are an unpleasant encounter. The tower defense minigame is out of place. And the navigation puzzles you are expected to solve while getting Desmond's story felt are completely pointless. Seriously, it would have been better to just let us hear the story and admire the surreal environment.Still, all things considered, AC:Revelations is the best AC so far.",

Despite others' complaints about the den defense mini-game, I was able to avoid triggering it even once while completing the single player campaign. Ezio's story does feel less important that Desmond's this time, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you enjoy in the series. I was glad to learn more about what was going on in the present-day world, and the reasons for all of the events that had taken place in the previous games. The game also wraps up Altair's story, which frankly was more fun than actually playing through the first game. Things are wrapped up nicely for Ezio, though the love interest bit seems very tacked on, and somewhat out of character for him. Despite some minor flaws, Revelations is a great conclusion to the AC2 series of games. Looking forward to AC3.",

It is an unnecessary addition to the franchise, but still better than Brotherhood, so if you haven't played that, just skip it and get to Revelations, you won't miss anything and the changes accumulated in these 2 games would actually be refreshing.",

Overall story only picks up a little later in the game, before that it'is very weak, basically running around in Constantinople. Oh, and there's virtually no follow up to Lucy's death in the previous game.Ezio's and Altaïr's memories regarding to Piece of Eden are somewhat interesting, but only towards the end of the game. And getting Altaïr's memories consists mainly of linear platforming sections in hidden tombs that are nothing like the historic locations of wonder from previous games - it's just a race to the end.Open-world in the city: repetitive, not interesting missions, even assassin ones. Spend most of the time trying to get from A to B, dodging people (I'm getting cramps from constantly holding RMB, W and Space), and missions are not creative at all, end quickly, with targets that you don't care about - not very interesting. City is huge but feels soulless, NPCs are mostly dummies, it's difficult to relate to, and events and characters don't help construct interest and care for the historic time and place. Overwhelming amount of collectibles to get and shops and buildings to renovate and for what reason? Mostly simply achievements, so, it's almost exclusively a time sinker. And den defense is a boring as hell tower defense that I managed to save myself and avoid altogether by constantly paying Herald's 100A to keep Templar awareness down....Combat and movement is the same as ever, that is to say it's clunky, with the same sometimes despairingly frustrating problems. Ezio keeps climbing or not climbing contrary to what you mean to do, making navigation frustrating, screwing up missions and challenges where you can't be detected or do things in a specific way. Targeting is difficult where there's many enemies, which is most of the time, making it difficult to fire or engaging a specific enemy, screwing up some challenges in missions like preventing allies from getting hurt. With all that, I ended up restarting memories a lot and feeling frustrated about it.Optional Desmond animus sections are visually cool, but there's only platforming to do, and it is frustrating and not rewarding - might as well just watch a YT video with the plot lines.Assassin management and world map control had potential, but ends up being a chore, and there's little rewards - some armor and weapons that are very good, granted, but you can complete the game just fine without them.Overall, playing this was mostly a drag, since the missions themselves were not creative and engaging in the slightest, and with all those control and combat problems, I ended up feeling like I should have just watched some videos on YT with the important cutscenes. There was little of the interest in the city, characters, events  and historic locales that the previous games had. And almost everything you can do in the city \"open world\" is repetitive and boring, might as well not be there. Of course, graphics are still good, as well as acting and voices.",

It had better visuals and even on console AC 2 was just simply an incredible achievement. While playing AC3 I understand they wanted to tell this new story but so far I just feel its disjointed. I'm not gonna touch on the story because everyone should know it from previews and reviews from other sources. My focused review is gonna be graphics and gameplay. I own it on pc and with pc with a pretty decent high end rig, this game looks ok with pretty good frames per second with little dropping in frame rate. But I feel at times like I'm playing a ps2 game. Don't know if anyone else gets that feeling. This game is unimpressive in graphics to me. Scope of the game is not that big as far as scale per section and the world feels somewhat linear in ways to go. You want a good open world game that you can be an assassin or play your style go to Skyrim. Skyrim is massive and looks way better. AC3 I was anticipating and was let down but is a decent game to play when I'm extremely bored. The small missions should be treated like mini games like the naval warfare. Everything feels short lived. Right when your having fun it yanks you from the excitement. It will force you to continue the pieces when you want to just explore even when your running around at will. Controls are awkward and it seems like the fighting is also a mini game. Hit counter thin strike then you just watch the fight unfold. This game feels to me like a interactive tech demo.  This is the game walk cutscene walk cutscene follow cutscene mini fight walk cutscene. AC2 didn't do this eveything felt right. I felt progression as a player with what I did and it made me care. This game doesn't make me care, most of the beginning parts of the story I've pressed to skip cutscenes because it take 3 hours to get to the exploring. Like I said some will love it but us detail explorers will be left wanting. I give this game a 6 out of 10 because the things I love about it are few and short of time. And the other majority of the game is almost wasteful. I wish developers would ask us consumers, What game would you like to play next? And what type of missions do you like? And above all I haven't notice and interview with a developer that the question is asked, Are there auto generated missions so after I beat the story there is something to keep me occupied after all the main and side content is complete. Credits to Bethesda for that achievement. Cause Skyrim seems like a rpg simulator style game than a COD or arcade short lived game like the games that have been released on the consoles and pcs for the last few years.",

This is my favourite game series, and this came so close to ruining it for me. The hook blade is a fine addition, the ziplines are cool (though are rarely placed where you need them), it's kind of nice having a smoke bomb that has a wide area, but apart from that I'm drawing a blank on the 'pros'. Ezio is back, because they'd rather drag him out for an annoying third encore for the audience to sit and clap through even though their hands hurt than they would leave the audience wanting more. Some of the characters you meet are cool, but I wasn't really invested in any of them. Any familiar characters from Ezio's former stories are stripped away from you. They become nothing more than a 'My Dearest Claudia' in the letters which serve as a few underdone quasi cut scenes to take you to the next DNA sequence. The Altair memories which were to be the most exciting element of the game are some of the WORST moments. The story of Altair's life beyond the first game and codex pages of Assassin's Creed 2 is either boring or not fully thought out, I can't tell which. All they needed to do to make playing as Altair the most fantastic experience was to give us the ONE leap of faith taken when taking the shortest route through Masyaf in the first game. INSTEAD it was decided that his movements should, for the most part, be limited to an irritating shuffle. Uphill. For the entire memory. And even in these sections, familiar characters were culled. It's as if the game made a deliberate attempt to alienate any loyal players who'd stuck around since the first game. The games physical space, while gorgeous and brilliantly colourful, is very limiting, or at least feels it. Then comes the excursion to Cappadocia - this nearly saved the game for me, a big statement, trust me. Arriving on that boat and stepping out only to realise it was a Templar CITY - the Templar equivalent of Masyaf - sent a genuine chill down my spine. It got off to a great start too! It's actually my favourite map out of all the games so far, with San Gimignano only just pipping it as best map to play through missions in. It feels big, and it feels dangerous, and it feels wonderful. Then you meet a woman who doesn't seem to need your help, but you help her anyway - she's sassy and capable and the coolest character in the game. Then she disappears from the entire game, when, after being there for five minutes, you for no apparent reason set the entire city on fire, killing hundreds, and leave. Why? I really don't know. And this was just one of a few decisions the game makes for you against your will. Among others are an assassination target who is quite obviously innocent for at least half the time you know him. You are forced to kill him anyway, because the game thinks you don't know that yet.The game feels shockingly and awfully unfinished and lazy. Things are rushed, questions are unanswered, every second character or plot device is a massive cliche and whole chunks of it seem to just be missing. For example, a mission exists to enlist the help of the city's Romani population, however, the leaders of the thieves and mercenaries guilds alarmingly acted as though they knew who I was when I had never spoken to them once, in any game.They took away good features and replaced them with gratuitous ones, they took away good characters and barely replaced them at all, and after this whole depressing ordeal the plot was so forgettable that I can't for the life of me remember what the point of it all was. More than anything I just feel supremely betrayed by this game.",

Of course as this is an assassin's Creed game, you'll be in an open world map and this time it's back to constantinople. The free running technique has been modified and feels better than brotherhood but the melee is basacly the same. The new mode Den Defence is not all that good and after a while will become tedious and boring. In the game you can also craft bombs which will help you in your story. As always the graphics deliver and are brilliant to see. The one thing that is completly outstanding, is the multiplayer. With new modes and even more wepons to play with you will be on it for hours on end. Verdict: This Game is amazing in multiplayer and the story is brilliant.As always the Graphics are good especialy in the first scene with Ezio. The music fit's the game but Den Defence is not the best. If your an Assassin's Creed fan get the game but it may feel a bit like Brotherhood.

It is extremely annoying at times, especially because it has already seen it's existence since AC2 and had gotten worse.. Crashes doesn't happen just once or twice, probably a good 10+ in total.Graphics wise, there isn't much improvements from the previous titles, and looks just slightly better.My conclusion is that if you've enjoyed Ezio, Altair, and Desmond's stories, then Assassin's Creed Relevations is one title that you cannot miss, an EPIC end to the Altair/Ezio story. If not, then you probably won't enjoy it a whole lot.",

Ezio’s elegance, class, humour and all round entertaining persona carried the Assassin’s Creed franchise away from the monotone days of Altiar, into the success it has enjoyed in recent years. The same can be said for Revelations.The greatest asset of this game is Ezio, the performance by Rodger Smith is spot on and the writing has actually improved in relation to his lines making it more sophisticated to create a more believable story around a man looking for answers, that have deluded him over the previous games. In fact the story that actually centres on Ezio himself has never been so good, it’s a shame the plot around Constantinople is significantly weaker, portraying a power struggling in the Ottoman empire that you simple don’t come to care to much about. Over the game the story of Ezio will be neatly and most importantly satisfyingly tied up into a nice ribbon, doing the previous two games justice. However to get to this point you will have to get threw the other story plots including the Ottomans.The truth about this game is that you have most likely played it before, the fundamental mechanics, gameplay and style of game has not changed drastically since Assassin’s Creed II’s release in 2009. You will still be sent on quests by colourful characters to assassinate certain targets, find out important information to progress the story line and occasionally a nice curveball may be included such as stealing a street entertainers clothing and instrument. There is nothing wrong with this formula, as we know it works, however three games later it’s starting to wear thin.It must be said that Ubisoft has tried to innovate in some areas however even with some success, not enough has been done to actually make this game feel like a sequel rather then an extension pack. The hook blade does in fact create a new stance on combat and exploration, also the introducing of bomb crafting is a nice touch. Beyond this though is nothing but a tedious fort defence game and minor tweaks to the open world map. There is no way Ubisoft could get away with making so little changes again.Leaving these quarrels behind, if you have played the previous two titles in this series Revelations is definitely worth getting to complete the tale of one of video games most beloved characters, if you haven’t played any of the Assassin Creed games, I would strongly suggest buying Assassin’s Creed II as you get the same gameplay with a better story for a much lower price.In conclusion Revelations was a game needed to put Ezio to rest and it does this well, so it should be commended. Lets just hope that Ubisoft has a something up its sleeve so that it can build upon such a successful franchise.",

If you're an average person with 8 hours of free time, then consider more than 4% of it wasted due to these damn long credits, so I've decided to rate the game at 4.Ok, now the other things.. First problem I noticed after starting the game was Desmond's new weird baby-face look. I didn't even recognize him at first, it was way too weird..Moving forward through the game, the story was becoming a bit too much of a mind****, what with Ezio using magic stones to get into Altair's memories and Desmond's mental health problems.. It all seemed way too shady though as everything else from the city was trying to get your attention. What I really didn't get was all the strange new mechanics that the previous games didn't have. To be fair, it's nice to see some new mechanics, but when they come out of nowhere, often leading to your death, you can't help but feel lost in the game. For example, Den Defense seemed new, so did the bombs and new (almost unbeatable) enemies, but I never really got to understanding them all, because there was way too much detail put into them to simply easily comprehend. It would've been good if the story missions didn't endlessly tempt you. The music from Jesper Kyd was great as always, though. I really had a problem with the characters on Ezio's story, they seemed very temporary. And on Altair's side.. I don't understand what happened to his voice. He used to have that calm American accent VA which was kind of a screw-up at first, but since they decided to make him speak in an Arabic accent this time, I could barely even recognize it was the same person. It would've been better if he just spoke the same way as before, would've brought some minor nostalgia.Overall, this game is just too clunky for me to be considered good. It's like they put Brotherhood into a pile of mud, then into a blender, and slowly cooked the resulting mass into what Revelations is now..",

So it goes for Ezio Auditore, who finally steps aside to make room for new champions in Assassin's Creed Revelations. The game sets you loose in a visually stunning recreation of 15h Century Constantinople, where you leap across rooftops like a renaissance superhero. But like many sequels, Assassin's Creed Revelations has many flaws. You lose horses and other serious improvements in the last game in favor of awkward mechanics that don't belong. Those include first person plat forming and tower defense battles. Neither of which are very good. Thankfully when Assassin's Creed Revelations remembers to be an Assassin's Creed game, it reminds you of what makes this series so great. Assassin's Creed Revelations isn't all about Ezio Auditore's story, it's also Desmond Mile's story. Here Desmond Mile's mind is a prisoner within the animus. This computerized space is presented as an island. Where shimmering doors leads to his ancestor's memories as well as his own. Playing as Desmond Miles isn't as entertaining as is it was in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. That's due in part to the levels that represent his memories. This synthetic cyberspace environments are a cool backdrop but the gameplay isn't fun. You create blocks and ramps out of thin air and move forward, but the jumping feels flat and the puzzles don't test your mind, they are just frustrating. This is one of Assassin's Creed Revelations attempt to force elements into a game that doesn't benefit from them. Unfortunately, you spend the bulk of your time as Ezio and sometimes as Altair from Assassin's Creed 1. It seems it's near the games conclusion throb with emotional resonance. Yes, there are a few great holy cow moments near the end, but it's the calm before the storm that tides two lives together and thus impresses the most. It makes you realize you will miss these Assassins of centuries past. As for Ezio Auditore's story, it's as tired as the older Ezio looks. Great voice actors sell every line, but the political intrigue among the Sultan's family just isn't that interesting. Still Assassin's Creed Revelations largely impresses thanks to how much fun it is to move through its' world. That's partly because of the gorgeous views. It's partly because of the fantastic soundtrack. But it's also because it's climbing and leaping is so joyful. The addition of the hook blade enhances the parkour of past games. You can climb faster, glide down zip lines and grab walls you would have missed in the past. You can also float downwards with parachutes. The result, plat forming is exhilarating as ever and certain set piece missions, like one in which you escape a burning boat ramp up the excitement. Not every set piece moment is as good as that one. Avoiding rocks as you drag behind a curating carriage isn't fun for example. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood did these kinds of scripted events better albeit Assassin's Creed Revelations does make important improvements. Assassin recruitment returns, but sending your brothers and sisters on missions now has more context. Setting Assassins to different cities reduces Templar control and increases Assassins control. The simple addition of a strategic element keeps recruitment from being simple busy work. In addition, there are quests you do with fully leveled assassins. Now, you actually feel like a mentor. An addition that isn't so good is that of tower defense. You capture Templar regimes, by killing commanders and lighting signal fires, but the Templars will try to get them back which means having to play a boring tower defense game. You stand on a roof, assign assassins to different locations and try to defeat waves of enemies. The simple mechanic structure make this a dull exercise and the camera close-ups of falling Templars disrupt the flow. Tower defense isn't all that's new. Now you can craft bombs out of ingredients you find. Combine them at a crafting station and viola. Bombs that explode release poison gas and so on. Combat has seen other changes such as awesome new finishing moves in addition of enemy gunners. Multiplayer returns as well, with some new modes like death match and capture the flag variant. Death match doesn't have the attention that the returning modes do. It's still more enjoyable to sling through the crowds, blending in while hoping your target slips up and makes himself known. Artifact assault gives you a chance to speed across rooftops with the enemies flag, which is quite fun. But, Assassin's Creed Revelations is at its best when it focuses on what the series does best. The first person puzzling and tower defense are bewildering additions, but when you skyrocket across the rooftops of this magnificent city, the stunning sites transport you to another century. Remember, \"Nothing is true... Everything is permitted\". \"La shai wak'ion motlaq bal kollon momken\". I would give this game a rating of 84 out of 100.",

While it's not revolutionary by far it improves on it's predecessors and delivers an interesting story in a rich and superbly designed environment.The story this times takes place in Constantinople and ties all loose ends. Apart from writing the final chapter for Ezio it also revisits Altair who is also a playable character in certain chapters. And it was great to learn what happened to Altair and how both he and Ezio are tied together. The cut scenes are really nicely put together and the whole story is quite interesting.Visually it's also an improvement although not breath taking. The characters are better animated, the environment is well designed and does remind of life teaming city packed with a lot of people. The map overall might be a bit smaller but it's so well designed that it's an actual improvement over the somewhat empty spaces we could encounter in the previous installments. I must admit the city - the way it looks, the way it's structured and how you move around it is what probably makes it my favourite Assassin's Creed game.The mechanics for the most part are the same. With just the addition of bombs which are quite annoying to craft and not that useful and the hook which lets you climb higher places and also zip line which is super fun - the rest almost unchanged. The whole structure of the game remains the same. And it's absolutely fine as you get to do them in a great environment.Overall as mentioned - definitely my favourite Assassin's Creed game. Though somewhat requires you to play the previous ones to fully appreciate the story it ties up. Can't recommend enough.",

There are no interesting characters, memorable chips or moments, too, only **** bombs sell, although they are not needed at all, there is management, but there is no sense in it, there is little equipment, it all opens only when passing each Chapter, you can buy different buildings, but it does not give anything and it is not interesting to do, plus it is very expensive. The only value of this part is the story of Altair and the way he came. It is sad that it is disgusting at the same time that Altair finished like this, although he lived to old age, there was a wife, children, faith, but...people is rotten, the order and with it the faith and commitment of those people who put everything to him. Oh Yes, and the ending is complete nonsense, but Ezio himself, who in part 2 was a young and cheerful boy, here turned into someone else,although one advantage it has that I did not become a slave to Apple and in the whole man he is not bad.Одна из всех серии игр которая вообще не зацепила. Все происходит на одной локации, побежал 500 метров для того чтобы взять задание, выполнил его, беги опять метров 300-500 и так всю игру. Персонажей интересных нет, запоминающихся фишек или моментов тоже, только сраные бомбы впаривают, хотя они и вовсе не нужны, есть менеджмент, но смысла в нем нет, экипировки мало, вся она открывается только при прохождении каждой главы, можно покупать разные здания, но это ничего не дает и этим неинтересно заниматься, плюс это очень дорого. Единственная ценность этой части, это история Альтаира и то как он кончил. Грустно мерзко одновременно, что Альтаир вот так закончил, хоть и дожил до преклонных лет, была жена, дети, вера, но...люди прогнили, орден а вместе с ним и вера и стремление тех людей которые положили для него все. Ах да еще и концовка полный бред, но и сам Эцио, который во 2 части был молодым и веселым мальчуганом, здесь превратился в кого -то другого,хотя один плюс он имеет, что не стал рабом яблока и в целом человек он не плохой.",

You need to think really carefully what you do with your heroes and what weapon you choose against a specific enemy. Nowadays, there are hardly any games like this one - games that demand from player to use his brain and not to just randomly hit keys like in AAA titles and spam an enemy to death. It won't work in here so any average triple A game fan might get lost in here.What I think is the best in the game is difficulty curve, which makes it real and competitive through all the gameplay. You can't just create immortal team of super-hero characters with legendary weapons all -around that hack and slash through everything. Every man in your team is a living being that can get killed just like any other man if you get a little too careless in a dangerous situation. This aspect of the game makes many fights puzzles where you have to think what to do; wheather to make a spear wall formation against dire wolves or take strategic advatnage of terrain and place your soldiers on grass tiles in a swampy area just to make the enemy come there and ... get stuck swamp.Economy is also nicely done as it gives you some options to earn money; you can either sell loot from defeated foes; trade certain goods in specific areas for bigger profit or get quest rewards. Generally, if you think you will have no economic problems in here.If you like to use brain in games and think of fights like of puzzles and you are looking for a virtual challenge then this game is for you.",

I think the endgame stuff (132 days) is designed to kill a handful of your veteran's (In my current save I have to take on 15 undead legionaries with necrosavants, honor guard, and undead priests in a god damn swamp)  and I get it your trying to make it gritty, but if you give the player no/very limited options to recoup than its an arbitrary middle finger and turns an otherwise fun game into an arbitrary frustrating waste of time. \"Rocks fall everyone dies\" in other words.TL:DR its gritty low fantasy XCOM set in medieval not Europe, with same intrinsic problems late game XCOM has.",

Despite much player feedback, devs are not responsive and slow to implement measures to allow for EASIER replacement of your men, which will allow for their death to be NOT SO FRUSTRATING (measure such as buying level with gold).Just this 1 con makes the game EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING (the MOST FRUSTRATING RNG game ever).

It has no endgame at all... none. So don't expect to get more than a week out of it.I'll just say the game started out strong then suddenly the difficulty fell off a cliff and everything got boring very fast. The worst was when the late game event started (orc invasion) I thought \"oh man things are going to get crazy now\". Nah still pretty boring. Then suddenly 30 game days later the war was suddenly over and some soldiers passing me on the road from a faction I was strongly allied with (and killed oh I dunno a hundred or so orcs for) called me a wuss and I was given the option to fight them or retire (LOL ok) so I chose to fight them and the friggin game won't even let you do that... Also a 30 day orc war!? Really only 30 days!? Laaaaaame! Why would you shoot your endgame in the foot like that? Even if I wanted to hit the \"continue onward anyway\" button they made this stupid level 11 cap for all the mercs. Why? There's no point in continuing the game anyway after the orc invasion because other events just don't happen and by that time you're overpowering everyone with heavy armor anyway. The game woon't even let you imagine that there's endgame content because there's no treasure hunts for unique weapons even worse the unique weapons you do find are the most boring underwhelming things I've ever seen... that's just laziness IMO. I'm sorry but this game is completely lacking in actual content after less than a week of gameplay.",

Somewhere between Expedition Conquistador, Battle for Wesnoth and Jagged Alliance.Pros:- the game is very \"atmospheric\", it portrays the cruelty of real battles (well, at least as much as you are allowed to do that in a mass-market medium like games).. E.g. the faces of soldiers get scarred and bruised as they take damage- the dialogs and texts are very well written and are interesting to read- the 2D graphics style with pawn-like soldiers actually works pretty well. It's great how, without any animations of soldiers, the battles still look nice. There are many faces in the game and they basically carry this game's whole visual style- a solid system of character upgrades, items etc - this reminded me JA2 the most- the world is randomly generated!So-so:- the utter randomness of everything. Most attacks are done at 30-50% hit chance, even when you are on a tile next to the target. Sigh.. I know all the argument about why RPGs have randomness but I'm a continental European, not an American or British, so I strongly prefer games without fog of war and no dice rolls. So, this game is NOT a strategy game, it's an RPG. If you like RPGs more than strategy you will love it, but if you're more into strategy you may find yourself replaying the same battle and getting vastly different results from basically the same tactics, which, to me, turns myself into some kind of a passive observer rather than active decision-maker. On the other hand, you can see this randomness as just the \"realism\". I mean, as a mercenary you can die any moment, even if you are very experienced and have all the best armor etc. Btw to prevent save scamming you can't save during battles.Cons:- (nitpicking) no tutorial, instead they have 2 videos on youtube (1 about combat, the other about the world map and party management) which I did find pretty well done. However, I'd prefer an offline tutorial. Without watching the videos, some game rules can't be easily guessed and will make your first experience very frustrating. E.g. if you archer is in melee range (1 tile) from an enemy, you can't retreat because the enemy unit gets a free attack. And not just but also if that attack hits then your move is cancelled! Such unusual stuff definitely requires a proper tutorial at game start.To me, if one could replace hit chances with damage multipliers (e.g. instead of having a 50% chance to hit you would just do 50% of damage but always hit etc) I'd love this game! Maybe this could even be done by editing the config files somewhere, no idea. Probably not though, since these chance-to-hit calculations are spread throughout the whole game, with a multitude of other factors tied to them.",

Not all of them work, but the designers are obviously experienced gamers.The biggest strike I would call attention to is that it plays a bit like a card or board game. These are casual experiences, designed to be completed in a couple of hours, so high risk game play works well. Not so well for computer games. In Battle Brothers, the risk to your crew is always very high and the time investment to develop your crew members is also very high (many, many hours of play). I think these two elements are not compatible. Being forced to recruit inexperienced cripples is a design idea that really does not work.Beyond the German setting, the structure of the game is reminiscent of an old classic called Darklands. Other people have noticed this as well. My opinion is that they should study this older game to help influence the evolution of this title a) because they are closely related in concept, b) because this game needs much more depth to reach its (lofty!) potential, and c) because Darklands was fantastic for its time and needs to be revisited.I really wish Overhype Studios well on this fine foundation. Triple A could be in their future.As a final note: Although the writer is talented, and I don't wish to insult him, his sense of humor needs to be weaned out the game. Monty Python-esque humor is very hard to do well. It is PhD level comedy ... not for the amateurs. I feel that the weak humor detracts from the play experience. The writer also ventures into inappropriate and obscene humor. This is not as widely acceptable as the current media would have you think. I feel this should be avoided.",

                  "Comment": "            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Battle Brother is a game which worth its price.Context :You are the new leader of a medieval warband due to the former captain's death against bandits. You will recruit, equip, level and eventually burry your battle brothers during your travels in a world randomly generated at each new game, between the icy lands of the north to south's sandy beaches passing throw swamp and dark forests.In each worldmap (Mount&Blade like), most of human cities and settlements are ruled by three noble houses, some are also independent, but all will offer you contracts more or less difficult to complete to earn reputation and gold.These contracts are very differents from one another, from caravan escort to orcish fights or graveyard exploration, on tacticals map depending on your location (forest, swamp, snow...).The combat system is very intuitive and tactical, specially recommended for those who like turn-based strategic games (like X-com but less inmersive).Your actions will determine your reputation. Will you be a cruel bandit or a noble mercenary ? Will you flee from battle to fight another day or die with honour ?Visual :See screenshots. The team's graphist is very talented. Arts are excellents and immerse player into game. I love style and textures, and specifically the days and nights effects traducing the time of the day from dawn to dust and vice versa.Audio :Just beautiful. Each ennemie has few specific musics.So with some experience you will know who is ambushing you just by listening ;)Gameplay :On the worldmap, if not paused, time is spending continuously during your actions (travel, camp, repairs, heal) with very nice visual effects. Your main job will be to take contracts, one contract at a time, in towns, castle and cities. Contracts are missions with a narrative context which if you take time to read, generate sometimes shivers or laughs. Suceed and will earn notorioty, gold and upgrade relationship with settlements.Gold is usefull to buy goods, food for your men, equip and heal them.Good relationship enables you to decrease marchant prices. Eventually a bad one will may end in a fight.Notorioty influence events ends or possibilities. Events are triggered depending on your action, the background of your men, their level, randomly... I let you discover those which are a good part of Battle Brother's richness.With all that you will mostly fight to level your men (if they survive) against abundance of ennemies (orcs, gobelins, bandits, knights, undead, ...). Each ennemy faction has its own tactics in battle and you'll have to adapt and prepare your men consequently. It is a nice challenge : panel of weapons, armors and skills will be the key to do so.Most of the time you will decide when and where you'll fight but not always due to night or surprise attack or ambush. Last but not least there are some dungeons to explore with legendary item as reward.As there is no really end to the game, as long as you survive, it's really great to play countless hours with the men you trained from their beginning to the mighty knight or agile bowman he has became (and you may cry their death).Cons :- Band limited, you will not able to rule a castle or manage anything different than your own warband.- No horses in a medieval game (wtf? ;).Pros :+ Very conscientious Devs listening to the community.+ Interesting skills-tree to develop your own tatics.+ Various ennemies (humans, beasts, greenskins, undead).+ Various armor, weapons, goods to trade or craft and more.+ No-end campaign or retire when you want (except premature death ;).+ Each game is unique.+ Donkeys !To conclude, Battle Brothers' world is mainly unexplored, dark and full of terrors. If you like the visual and turn based tactical game with a deep RPG immersion do not hesitate.",

The story takes about 5 hours to finish, which is a little quick but including the collectables, 10 mini kits, one blacksmith recipe, and three treasures a mission, plus the red bricks for quests giving you special abilities will add tons of hours onto it. There's not to much wrong with this game except for the few glitches that happened to me in the middle of missions where I couldn't get out of a space and made me restart the mission. I also wish there were checkpoints, since in some missions mini kits spawn in places where if you miss it there's no going back.

No.  Is it as good as the originals?  No.  TT is trying to change so much that they are really breaking some of the fundamental things that made Legos fun.Let's start with the most obvious - the voices.  This was marked as a big deal but honestly I never liked it.  One of the things that makes Legos so fun is watching their silent acting.  The actions were funny even if you didn't understand what they were trying to say.  Adding voices has ruined that experience.  The game just isn't funny like all the other Lego games.  Forget the \"true to the movie\" crap.  This just isn't a funny game to play.  I wish they had provided the option to turn off the voices.They added some new features to the game but I think they detract more than they add.  TT has added yet another set of collectibles that allow you to...do nothing but get more collectibles.  This is tied to the side quest concept.  Neither of these do anything for the game other than extend its length.  The quests aren't fun and don't move the story forward.  Some of the collectible items are suppose to be useful (allow you to use a single char with all the abilities) but some of the key abilities still cannot be obtained without using certain characters.  This was a half-hearted implementation and does nothing for the game.Fortunately there were no vehicles in this game (because TT has never gotten them right).  But they replaced that will yet more jumping puzzles that test your patience.  If you don't jump at the right time you lose the puzzle.  Losing the puzzle means starting all over again.  Some puzzles can take minutes to complete.  TT does anybody there actually evaluate how much time you are wasting of gamers' times because of these crappy puzzles?  If they were straightforward then this would be a different scenario but often times the camera angle changes, you have to switch characters (which is messed up), jump at just the right time or a series of other actions that cause failure.  The jumping puzzles aren't fun.  I remember when Lego games were for younger kids.  I doubt most 8 yr olds could easily complete them now.Changing chars is painful in this game.  You really have to understand what is going on or you can mess things up.  If you \"quick\" select a char from the radial and that char is already on the screen (either the second controller char or because of story mode) then you switch from the first to the second char's location.  If you're in the middle of a puzzle you just got screwed.  If you use the full roster screen or the char is not visible then the current char switches.  This leads you down the path of always using the full roster just to be safe.  The problem with the full roster is that, especially with timed events, it is slower and can take a while to get the char you want.All in all this game attempts to move the Lego games forward but I think it actually takes them a step back.  I hope voices, the horrible jumping puzzles and odd char selection behavior don't make their way into the next Lego game.  This isn't the worse of the serious but it is nowhere near the best.  Bring us back the fun Lego games TT!!!",

The HUB is awesome, a completely open map (I can literally walk from Hobbiton to Mordor in 5 minutes) and justifiable times of day. It also comes with an even greater variety of characters, as well as your on character DIY setup (based in Frodo's home). There are two problems, however. First, the side quests take an immense amount of time to complete, with little to no reward. Second, the actual missions in the populated areas (such as Helm's Deep and Bree) lack in creativity and the adventurous spirit of Tolkien and make you yawn. I would recommend this game to any casual gamer.",

The only annoying thing about this game has to do with the platforming...it's sometimes hard to judge how far to jump due to the camera and you will fall into the water countless times. Other thing is when playing alone your secondary character rarely helps out and usually just stands there. So you have to control the second character too. It's a bit odd considering in the other Lego games the secondary character was automatic. Overall though, the game fantastically captures the spirit of The Lord of the rings.",

After completing the story in approximately 45 hours over the span of 4 months (march~july) and spending a lot more with quests and extra \"post-game things\" to do (no spoilers~), I have to thoroughly admit that this game is something that all RPG fans should play! Now, is it as good as EOIV? Let's see the goods and bads before comparing the two.The Goods: Etrian Odyssey Untold is a freshened, remade version of the first game, which was released around 6/7 years ago (2007). It has a story mode, and the story mode serves as the main mode that etrian players will play. The classic mode is still there for people who want to use their own crew for fighting....and stuff. So, down to the story mode - it's surprisingly great. I found the premise of the story to be a bit niche, but the way they presented it was really spectacular, and the scripting was as good as ever, convincing me to continue to play it until the end. It was really emotional towards the end and I have to applaud Atlus for being able to shake my iron soul. The graphics are as good as ever for a 3DS game, and the 3D effect is really well implemented, as always. The character designs are really nice, and the backgrounds are really detailed and well drawn. The music was something from another planet. Yuzo Koshiro really did a splendid job remastering the songs from the first game into an orchestrated/live version of it for this game. I never turned the volume down or turned off the BGM throughout the whole time, and actually kept it at max volume while keeping the others down. You see, there are FOEs (strong bosses that roam the labyrinth) that cruise around, keeping you scared and alert, and they are really programmed well this game. The puzzles that you have to solve to avoid fighting them is really well designed, and some of the later stratums require a lot of thinking to avoid these nasty fights. The fighting system is as good as ever, with the inclusion of Grimoire Stones, which from what I know..are stones that contain enemy's (or human) skills that can be used if the weapon type is the same as the user......which can be confusing, but you'll learn more about it ingame~. The dungeons are wonderful as ever, the feeling you get from mapping is splendid, and the 3 difficulties you get from the beginning of the game are great for beginners and veterans (I chose the standard diff, fyi). The bosses are really tough, most of the time, and things get really intense, again, towards the end of the game. Definitely worth the effort of grinding~The Neutral: It's good that voice acting has been implemented more, but it may be nicer if more things were spoken. I felt that they only spoke 1 or 2 important lines in central parts of the story, and not really talking much in other \"branches\" of the story that I also felt were somewhat important. Again, although it's something that has never occurred in the franchise, I have always thought that a city hub would be nice (one that you could explore), but it seems you'll be stuck with menus for this game as well, which isn't exactly a problem. Another neutral thing is the grinding at the start of the game. You're really going to have to spend a bit of time (although it's easier in this game) grinding for a while to get a decent load of cash and skills/levels. The game is also a tad bit to the boring side for the first 10-20 hours, and after that - things really get awesome and super intense! (especially the story, but you'll have to wait it out for a while)The Bad: There isn't really much here that I can say...though there is one thing I can think of. It'd be nice if the game had more than 1 slot for saving, because after finishing story mode, I wanted to try Classic mode but I didn't want to delete my old file, so it kinda creates a problem for people like me who want to try out everything that's featured in the game without deleting anything.VS EOIV and Overall: Compared to EOIV, I'd say this is a better game to start with, but notice that it's definitely more difficult than EOIV - especially with endgame bosses and the last few stratums being very very difficult to beat and navigate through (and map). Although EOIV has the wonderful world system (\"Lands\") and Untold lacks it, I'd say that Untold still holds pretty well with EOIV. Of the two though, I'd say I like EOIV more by only a small percentage. I truly had a great experience with EO Untold, and hopefully this review can sway you (hopefully and RPG fan) to have the wonderful experience that I had whilst playing this game~Gameplay: 10/10Story: 9/10Music: 10/10Presentation: 9/10Length/PostGame: 9/10Overall: 9/10",

Etrian Odyssey is a game series based on exploration and preparing. One false step, one missed hit and its the end for you.The overall game is very much enjoyable. The graphics, mainly Anime-style, are very well drawn and you have a whole variety of them. About 4 for each class and additional ones for specific characters and NPCs.As you enter the game you are greeted with a beautiful sounding soundtrack that expands on the whole Labyrinth you will explore. However having played the original, the remakes just don't sound as good. They are still quite good though.And now we are already at the part that I love about this game. Everyone who has played this knows about the end of the game. Well \"end\". The big Twist about this game to be specific. And that is where the two new modes come into play. I myself already know the secrets and know whats coming for me but seeing how the characters in the story mode discover it for them-self makes it even better. It is like a Anime that you have to play along to unlock more and more the further you get. But of course the Story mode has a lot more to offer than the actual old classic mode. New maps, new quests and most importantly: New areas.This comes into play as I hear many people moaning about the fact that this game does not have a Over-world map. Correct me if I am wrong but I am pretty sure that the Over-world map came with later installments of the series. And as of right now I am very happy about the fact that they did not make a Over-world map. I see though where an Over-world map could come into play. it just wouldn't fit.If you want a challenging and interesting game to play than Etrian Odyssey, the series as a whole (except the Mystery Dungeon Spin-off) is a game you should play.",

It was a lot of fun and i loved  the map making, which is supposedly a big part of the series. I think the combat skill tree system wasn't that hard to grasp, and i like how character stats only showed up when purchasing items, so it was overall simple. I wish the combat was a little more engaging, however. It kind of reminded me of digimon dusk and dawn's combat, because the characters were doing amazing things but all you saw was bursts of fire and squares shaking as they took damage. I wasn't expecting pokemon X and Y grade combat graphics, but I feel, especially since the story had fixed players they could model, they could have made a few general animations for when they attacked, even if they were simple like what the enemy monsters did. I like the first person, but it felt weird to have a main character that felt apart of me and separate from me at the same time. The dialogue options didn't normally change the story, but allowed a little humour here and there. However, i couldn't fully feel like it was me adventuring with the others, but rather me controlling the main character. When i get this feeling, i don't wish i had more control. I wish the main character had more character of his own. Finally, the grimuar stones (probably spelled that wrong, though) were a nice feature that was apparently new, but i think they could have simplified it. If i forgot to edit my stones after a few trips back from the forest, i would suddenly find 20 or more new stones and feel overwhelmed. Perhaps they could have made it so i could extract skills individually and recycle ones i didn't want to level up skills i wanted to keep, that way my only question was which skills i wanted, not which stone i wanted to make. Overall, love the experience",

For those who don't know, this game has two modes to choose from when starting a game. The story mode is the one with a plot and voice acting. The classic mode is choosing your teams jobs from the start, unlike the story mode where you are given a party of five members and can only change their class after reaching level thirty. THE BAD: I found the ending to be disappointing in my opinion. It felt rushed and was very short. Changing your class in story mode does not change the portrait of the character. So, if you change a defender to mage or whatever else, the picture will still show the defender turned mage still holding a shield and sword. Now, this isn't a major gripe of mine but I just wanted to mention it because it was one of the reasons I didn't change classes. THE GOOD:MUSIC: The music was awesome. From slow piano to roaring guitar solo, it's in this game. I found myself nodding my head to some of the battle music.GRAPHICS: Graphics are good for 3DS. The dungeons are each unique, dessert, sea, forest, jungle, demolished city, it's all there. The dungeons were. nice to look at. Nothing ugly to say the least. GAMEPLAY: The battle system is turn based and quite fun. Also,the level up system is great. Every time you gain a level, you get a point to distribute to a skill or Stat boost. So you can take your character in the direction you want to. Well, no heavy knight combined mage, but still. I felt it was very nicely done. VOICE ACTING: The voice acting is great as well. Even Chie's voice actor from Persona 4 is in this game. STORY: The dialogue wasn't overly childish as many other games I have played have been. The story was good. Just the ending was disappointing because it was too short. CLOSING COMMENTS:I would recommend this game to anyone who is a hard core RPG gamer. Bear in mind this is a dungeon crawler and it's not for everyone. There were times when I would get slightly nauseated from the dungeon crawling. This isn't unusual for an RPG though but definently expect it from dungeon crawlers. Also note, if you are an adult and are looking for a more mature dungeon crawler, then check out Demon Gaze and Dungeon Travelers 2 for the PS Vita.That wraps it up, hope it helps.",
